Lets not forget that Apple Pay in 2014 required a brand new iPhone in order to use it  A significant portion of Apples user base wasnt able to use it even if they wanted to  As each successive iPhone incorporated the technology and older iPhones were replaced the number of people who could use the technology increased,1.0,325

Whenever I go to a place that doesnt take Apple Pay doesnt happen too often its such a drag Between contactless Covid habits and my getting the Apple Card Ive gotten so used to Apple Pay that I get seriously annoyed when a store doesnt take it It feels like a shock its crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine Ive officially been brainwashed by Apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket,0.0,459

Guys a quick note that you do NOT need all the highend tech in order to do well at college If you can and you should save as much money as you can while at college pay your tuition in full and student loans as soon as possible instead of spending on liabilities like gadgets Get the bare minimum you need and only spend money on products you know you are going to be using for 46 years such as laptop Dont overspend on phone headphones lamps tablets etc,1.0,471
this is hilarious i was in a focus group over 4 years ago for Best Buy where they were asking college students how to advertise for Back to School One of the kids next to me said Maybe you should have someone like MKBHD talk about your products Well here we are,1.0,269
Everyone has been saying it but Ill throw my hat in as well To any prospective college students you DO NOT need to spend money on flagship products I am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base iPad from late 2020 Both products have worked flawlessly and I have no intention of replacing them The recommendations listed are ones I would never be able to afford even with my job Im working as well Do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is I promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it,2.0,634

You dont necessarily need the highend and latest tech for University  I used a 2009 macbook pro throughout my years at uni  had an iphone 6 and it worked out just fine Whats important is to remain focused on getting that degree and graduating,2.0,249
Personally I feel like this is really out of touch Most students wont be able to afford these In case anyone needs it I believe Dave2Ds back to school video are honestly the best ones Ive seen on the topic Consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision,2.0,278
"Hey everyone Good take on the video and love the recommendations If you plan on making another video such as this maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options 

What I can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what coursesprogramme you took for your education
Engineering students require computer specs that can run BIM software Im not sure about the other programmes but from what I can see that most students at my place has 8GB of RAM for their laptops

Also here is my setup during my university years Hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their collegeuniversity years All the best

I have used Galaxy Tab S7 during my PhD Its been a lifesaver for me First of all it is really good for reading journals note taking and scribbling on the pdfs secondly it doesnt strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with Tab s7 and lastly if you are from a STEM background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams you can draw those easily with the stylus on Tab s7 I choose tab s7 over Apple Ipad Air for its ease of use user interface and cost you get stylus for free with Tab S7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount,2.0,679

"Regarding Cans vs Bottles At least in Germany the bottle is more environmentally friendly since they get used again and again You bring the empty bottles to the local grocery shop they then get sent to a cleaning plant where they pressurewash the bottles inside and out with steaming hot water Afterwards they get reused for beer The size and shape of most bottles is according to a standard so different brewers use the same bottles

Its far less energy intense than smelting and remanufacturing cans",1.0,513

"Back in 2018 when John Oliver did the episode on Corporate Consolidation it inspired me so much that I applied for a Masters of Research program got into a program and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies It was shocking to see how bad it really is oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant My research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue The answer was that it was truly both I thoroughly enjoyed my predoctoral masters thesis and am considering a PhD in the future Its so lovely to see John talk about this specifically on the tech sector

Hey something that might interest you A couple of days ago my Amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time theyre telling me its for excessive returns which I think is an error but thats beside the point When they closed my Amazon account all my Amazon devices that I own for years primarily all my Echo devices stopped working I lost access to the Amazon Photos and Prime Video which I pay for So apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by Amazon on your perceived shopping habits I assume the same applies to all other Amazon devices and services like fire OS tablets Ring cameras and probably AWS as well Just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely dont tell you this when you buy your hardware and services,0.0,805
"Points that were missed 

 Apple arguably has a specific Monopoly in the US with smartphones because of iMessage not being open with other multiplatform messaging apps This weirdly only applies in the States The rest of the world favours things like WhatsApp and Facebook messenger  both owned by meta Which is its own issue Thats probably the main defence Apple will bring up 

 theyve been in trouble before but dont forget about Microsoft Windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove 

 this kind of got glossed over but although Google play takes the same cut for purchases as Apple you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like so they avoid the heat there Google play is still the most preferred store on Android phones so Google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software",1.0,944

as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach  this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting  it is a huge vector for exploit  it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself,0.0,620

"I have a high paying tech job that Im about to leave I feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it even though I worked hard to get to where I am I was promoted very fast after 5 years I know its something many people would love to have and honestly Im happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot Ultimately I became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life I have lived humbly saved every thing I could paid off debts as quickly as possible and have enough to live for 8 months to a year Im hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling

For anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining I hope you achieve your dream and get one You can do it keep at it Taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing I am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me dont let that scare you I just have my own personal stuff too ",2.0,1027
Im a Software developer I understand the struggle but us tech workers should count our lucky stars We are very privileged to be where we are Most jobs outside of tech have less perks much lower pay and more stress I am grateful everyday to be in this field Once I accumulate enough wealth to purchase my freedom Ill see myself out maybe In the meantime I will run the race as long as I have to,2.0,408
The thing is if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility You must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially Leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows theyre taking time off This also empowers your teams letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders,2.0,521
Compare that to  physicians only 42 said they were burned out  Yes indeed a perfectly acceptable percentage,2.0,118
I worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out The problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused You can barely keep up Though I got promoted regularly my higher ups told me the truth before they left they said that I was severely underpaid based on my skills essentially I branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as I am both technically knowledgeable people oriented and strategic I maxed out at 50K So I decided to jump ship with little planned Now I run a financial agency with my husband and we make 250K a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle,0.0,660

"Yup its amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country In germany we have an entirely different line of knockoff chinese brands Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian  american market I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea Japan if anybody could give a hint to that I mean surely they must have great dashcams right Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind

I bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine Problem I have with it is quality related the GSensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings And in that mode you cant disable the screen from flashing so at night drives youll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope Its your f dashcam You can improve further the video quality for eg when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a NDFilter you just have to find your own way to mount them Usually there is full filter clamping solutions Because youll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow

"When I went looking for a dashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instead of a battery cause I really dont think the batteries would handle the 20 to 30c temps in winter and the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior I know you can take them off but I kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system

I want to know what problem that Quantum computer solved in a few minutes that would take a normal computer 10000 years,1.0,121
"AI is the most important one a lot of people think AI is going to somehow mean self awareness consciousness at some point
The main implications of AI is that it is self improving the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen
is that AI is going to overtake humans in a lot of things including research and science It is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change
everything about life far more than the industrial era did For  example 300 years from now we can have an AI program that has been improving itself for 300 years
We lose about 14 million people each year from car accidents and that is just fatalities there are also many more injuries So while I understand people being
skeptical about machines driving cars as time goes on it is not even going to be close AI is going to be able to do many many things better than humans
At some point these quantum computers are going to make AI they could program an AI to make a better AI of itself an improved version
Then the 2nd one can make a 3rd one that is better then it etc etc
There is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens",1.0,1251

Hey Marques I know these sound insignificant but since you rarely update your little donglesaccessories that you carry around and your apps on your home screens I think it would be interesting to get a little maybe quarterly series where you talk about any changes and what youd like to see changedsimplified with those work flows Just an idea,2.0,351
MKBHD Im a photographer and use the Peak EDC V2  Im impressed you got a 16 into the 20L  Im sure its a snug fit and doesnt leave alot of room for a ipad too  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag here goes The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones airpods etc go  You just have to fish a cable through the corner  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs that means I plug in all my devices when theyre in the zip area laptop phone tablet and airpods and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place  Not only that when theyre done charging the battery starts charging  I wake up with everything ready to go  Hope you enjoy trying this out ,2.0,998

other than that nice tech kit

Also yeah your experience with the Pixel 6 mirrors my past experience with Pixel phones I got one to try something different to the iPhone and I loved it for a few months I tried a few customizations but found that leaving it stock was generally the best experience for me Then it started unexpectedly slowing down or apps would wig out and crash on me out of nowhere or the camera just wouldnt or it would reboot in the middle of doing something",2.0,793

This is a common misconception While part of the reason was the battery being too thin the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch which was a tiny dent in the top left corner This would cause the battery to eventually short out as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other Most peoples phones were exploding while fast charging which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery and lithiumion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that

"Something important to know for all who are interested in history andor support Ukraine 

Rus ought not to be confused with Russia which derives its name from the Rus but historically is a completely different state which almost all its existence was at war with the Rus 

Just like the Holy Roman Empire was actually Germany Russia is actually Muscovy despite their best attempts to convince everybody otherwise 

Its name Russia received only in 1721 when Peter I passed a decree to change Tsardom of Muscovys name into the Russian Empire Russia originates from Rosia name used by the Greek Orthodox Clergy in regards to Kyivan Rus
Under the reign of Cathrine II Muscovites where even punished for continuing to identify as Muscovites and were forced to call themselves Russian 

Lands that Russia claims were part of the original Rus but actually werent are Novgorod Suzdal and Ryazan since in historical texts of XIXII centuries they are mentioned as separate entities from Rus They can be considered parts of extended Rus although their culture was distinct from main Rus

In 1493 Moscow prince Ivan III appointed himself to be the Great Ruler of All Rus No other kings acknowledged that From that point on Muscovy started to make false claims on Rus ownership

Russia is an offshoot of Ukraine and not the other way round despite what Soviet and Russian historians have been trying to say for years Kiev was a developed cultured capital when Moscow was just another swamp village




Germany used to call itself the Holy Roman Empire that didnt mean they became the Romans and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of Italy and its history but yet thats exactly what Russia did in regards to RusUkraine which is a horrible injustice",1.0,1813

Netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other distributors This move into gaming will not do them any favours,0.0,155
The reason Netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content their own content when its good is constantly neglected and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it Getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what theyre doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults People are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update People are used to getting the next season of a series once every year but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release even before COVID,0.0,654

The original infamous hurt my soul I played through the campaign twice on hard to get the platinum only to find out while I was doing cleanup that the stunt master trophy cant be completed post game I had all but one stunt to knock 3 enemies off a roof at once When you clear out an area enemies no longer spawn in large numbers therefore there isnt enough enemies to get the stunt I didnt have it in me to start another campaign The sad part is I had tried the stunt on multiple occasions only for it to glitch and not award the stunt,0.0,546

I adopted a mindset of delaying my gaming brain by a year If a game comes out in 2022 I wait until 2023 I get it at its cheapest and usually complete I have been doing this with every game I buy for the last 5 years and I have saved so much money while enjoying the games much more,2.0,286

"Good video These are the kinds of topics and discussions the gaming industry needs to need to be having now Publishers developers the media and gamers themselves 

Have to throw one in though For every game with a yearly release I also have to point out games with decade or more release cycle How long between GTA 5 and 6 Fallout 4 and 5 Skyrim and Elder Scrolls 6",2.0,377
"I wish developers would realize that forced DRM and Internet connectivity for games is a step backward Look at the debacles GT7 and SimCity have endured whats the point of paying a full 70 for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure especially if this ridiculous requirement is in place for SINGLEPLAYER modes

In my opinion at that point you cant help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job This is not why people play games",0.0,510
When I think about the games I played the last few years I must say that I almost always enjoyed indie titles alot more than big IPs So I rather pay 30 for an indie title that is really inspiring with fresh new ideas than wasting 60 on a broken AAA title without any innovations,2.0,286
Great vid points are spot on only 4 or 5 years ago feels like I bought every major release at midnight and after Cyberpunk Fallout No Mans Sky Im never buying a day one game again  My gaming and spending habits have completely changed  The gaming biz cant devolve and expect players to keep up the old pace,1.0,318
I havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now The gaming industry has changed for a while now and its only getting worse I buy 34 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted Quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays CoD and Battlefield lost their way Quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy GoTY editions usually and often second hand gotta love disc edition systems I refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers,0.0,549

Ive been around for every console generation  I remember thinking during the GenesisTurbografx era SNES not out quite yet what games would be like when I was old and the kind of specs they would need  Obviously I had no idea what the specs really meant back then but I was thinking 256bit lol  as for the CPU and 64bit is all we really need for that  They have happily progressed faster than I had imagined looking just as good today if not better then I imagined things would look like 2025 years from now  The 1990s and early 2000s with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the GPU were the main things that took us to where we are hardware wise,2.0,687
"We are an architecture and construction company in Chile and we have used Unreal Engine for a long time and it is the best for realtime visualization  The preview versions of Unreal 5 were already spectacular and the best thing is the lighting  Lumion really changed everything

Whats your DREAM specsize for a gaming monitor,1.0,49
Wow Im impressed think theyve set a new bar with that spec and it being a 42,2.0,80
This monitor looks really clean with almost no bezels I like how its got a tilt adjustable stand as well Nice video,2.0,118
On your future review will you give us a comprehensive analysis on the antiglare matte screen Is the matte coating embedded within the panel or is it another layer Do you notice any sacrifices on color and sharpness because of the matte finish Do you find its brightness setting to be adequate for an OLED monitor during productivity use How aggressive is ABL in your testing Please let us know Thank you,1.0,413
My favorite part of this tv 42 is basically tv size is the custom heatsink I dont care too much about the size of the back of the monitor as long as it doesnt dim the brightness constantly,2.0,196

Wow please compare to the C2 you had as a monitor side by side to see that contrast difference uniform brightness difference etc for those comparing the C2 42 and this Love your content",2.0,201
"Thanks for the review i cant wait for your full review

My dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this  42 inches or so antiglare normal aspect ratio not ultra wide but 1440  200mhz instead of 4k because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k  138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway

If possible i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review

 What do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor try playing a game in 10801440 and seeing what the monitors scaling is like
 In the settings what HDR options are available

Thanks",2.0,631
"Hi SpawnPoiint Im looking forward to the complete review youre the most thorough and thoughtful reviewer Ive seen

One thing Id like to see in the review is a comparison with a matte screen ideally a sidebyside in different conditions to illustrate the pros and cons and help us decide what coating we prefer
Dont know if thats feasible for you In any case thanks for the work and enjoy ",2.0,404

theory the reason why you saw a second karl might have something to do with abandoned cars like Cristine Karl is the first abandoned car and over time it withered and due to the desert heat its paint melted all over it making it all covered in blue paint and eventually a bunny accidently glitched in there and died and theyre soul got sucked in creating the first karl which then killed the player and over time the karl became more and more smart and even attained sentience and started converting other cars into karls and karrot and karla were his first ones which had a few problems which is why they are diffrent eventually karl found out about you and how many times you abandoned cristine and the last time you did he converted all of the old ones he kept on finding new ones not going back and getting them back and are now mad at you and your stupid sedan it also explains why he keeps coming back,1.0,913

Gotta love Lenovo Got the Ryzen 5600H version of this laptop with the same 3050 after seeing the positive reviews you guys gave it and I couldnt have been happier It was 700 in Italy at the time Paired with my Wacom Cintiq and a RAM upgrade its been the perfect little gaming and Digital painting set up,2.0,310
People have been going crazy for the gigabyte G5 KD going for a relativelyaffordable price for an i5 11400H and RTX 3060 would be cool to see you guys buy and review it to see how good it is,2.0,191
Lenovo always been crazy in the budget gaming laptop market My first introduction to PC gaming was a 1080p lenovo with SLI 750ms Was a killer deal too Back when the 7 series was Nvidias newest line I remember looking up so many videos about its performance in games weeks before I got it I havent gotten anything Lenovo since as I build my own towers now and get much more premium laptops but I will always appreciate and respect what Lenovo does,2.0,458

Nice Definitely a great value  I still have my old Lenovo 960M 4GB gaming laptop I never upgraded it from 8gb of ram and that wouldve been an easy move for more performance Now it doesnt make sense as I upgraded to an Alienware with a 3080 and 32gb of ram but I still sometimes fire up the Lenovo to see what it can do in 2022,2.0,333

I honestly think Marques should start a gaming channel only so we can appreciate him enjoying his tech in the way most people will do Being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticisingwhich to be fair no one with sense would think he doesnt enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition,2.0,584

"The part where theyre talking about the initial rollout of the SNES in North America hits home They mention something about how expensive it was for the time and how the state of the US economy in 1991 meant it was probably the only toy the average American parent could buy their kids that year Took up the entire toy budget

That happened to my family Christmas 1991 and all my brothers and sisters are there 4 of us ranging from 10 to 18 years old My parents had a single present for the 4 of us the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World

It was one of the best gifts of all our lives because we had all wanted the SNES badly We literally played it all that Christmas Eve night and into Christmas day Its a great family memory that we all still hold with us now all in our 40s and 50s with families of our own",1.0,832

1442 this is the most painful one on this list if you ask me Out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses this ones just different The game was over lol Its not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown The game is literally over all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and thats it The Washington Wizards were up by 3 at that point Even if the apposing team has time to foul you you hit just 1 free throw and its over Even if you miss both they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to TIE the game in an impossible amount of time Long story short that throw lost them the game after OT lol Just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards Gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history,0.0,821

"Very entertaining one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected  I remember my wife was given a free ticket to a Diamondbacks game which went zerozero so she finally left and when she came home she said I got bored with the game  The Diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left winning the game  

I teased her endlessly after that suggesting she should not attend more Dbacks games and they went on to win the world series that year my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the Yankees and Luis Gonzalez base hit that won the game

I met Joe Montana and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl and I saw the ending in French in Montreal in 90   During my flight from SFO to Toronto and the connecting flight to Montreal our Air Canada pilot gave us updates on a onesided blowout

I also will never forget the StanfordCal game in 82 and The Play when Cal beat Stanford and the band became part of the game  Some still argue over two of the lateral passes but the win for Cal was as it was and I still say that is among the craziest moments in sports history

My own crazy moment was when I was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team even though I was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team the school we played had no players above the sixth grade so I agreed  We won the game though I had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game  Adrenalin had me psyched and our QB said I threw perfect spirals  I would intimidate the bigger players since they feared Id plow under them and stop them from getting to the QB and they never did he was not sacked

Our team went on to win the Norcal championship undefeated in our twelve team league my brother playing as wide receiver though I no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders  I never went on to play in high school feeling I was too small to be as good as I was in my grammar school game where I also played on the defense and I stuck to distance cycling and golf both of which I enjoyed and also had many crazy moments and I was decent at the 440 as it was then now the 400 meters

Even in my early 60s now and despite a leg I broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago I still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing

De Bruyne brilliant as always Nice to see Haaland can get the assists as well as the goals,2.0,92
its crazy how much Haaland can affect the game even with few touches his runs are always pulling players and opening up space for city to play Once they start getting used to him being there for tap ins too its gonna be even scarier,0.0,237
Haaland shouldve gotten the ball a couple times However he opened up so much space just by being on the pitch He is a threat and the teams know it,1.0,150
Kevin De Bruyne world class as usual Haaland shouldve at least gotten on the scoresheet if Foden squared him in but at least he got an assist He can still find a way to contribute without goals,2.0,199
Seems like Man City still havent fully adapted to Haaland at least 2 more goals wouldve been scored If they had given him the ball in the right areas,1.0,153
That first half was a masterclass by KDB and that goal using the outside of his foot was terrific,2.0,101

With the way things are going it will be Marouane Fellaine at 1159pm on Deadline day,1.0,87
Quality player is Casemiro  also a DM which weve cried out for The concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at Madrid We are said to pay him an eyepopping 400k a week is what Ive heard  thats typical United one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable unmotivated players who we then cant move on when its time As I say quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but wont helps us achieve anything substantial As for Pulisic Ive always been quite underwhelmed by him albeit you can see he does possess good quality I probably wouldnt be averse to a loan though it cant be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping Rashford does anything productive every week,0.0,872
One question I have is will Ten Hag play Casemiro when he joins United Or will he stick to the 2 greatest midfielders ever played football Mctominay and Fred,1.0,159
The reality is that when he was at Ajax Ten Hag didnt choose the players At Ajax they have a solid recruitment area full of great ex players At Manchester United,2.0,175
We are a absolute mess If Casemiro was the target why wasnt he signed 2 months ago We just panic and buy whoever with no strategy man Im not saying Casemiro is a rubbish player he is quality Its just Man Utds approach to signings is a joke Plus im not overly keen on giving a 30 year old a 5 year contract at 250k a week  but ill literally take anything over Scott and Fred ,0.0,387
Casemiro would be a fabulous signing for us i cant bear to watch McTominay play again,2.0,86

Probably the best game Ive seen from Harry Maguire in a long time His absence from the game was pivotal in Uniteds win,2.0,122
ten Hag was on the pitch 45 minutes before the warmup placing cones and balls in precise spots  His body language was full of intensity and concentration  He looked like a man on a mission,2.0,192
This is a good coach Hes clearly a floor general and knows how to drive results This is the guy you want you to lead your team especially if they have been so illdisciplined like United has for the last few years If this was basketball he is the type of point guard you want Hes got excellent standards and definitely the mindset of a champion,2.0,353
As a Liverpool fan I have to say that I admire how Ten Hag approached this game he is great to listen to Honest and intelligent Not afraid to leave out some big egos for the greater interest of the team respect,2.0,215

Sometimes the balance of a team depends on very little",1.0,418
I loved Ten Hags comment the other day about he has always had slow starts at every club he managed but he always got the job done He has total belief in himself  it showed on the pitch last night that the players have belief now too,2.0,237

Confidence isnt I know theyll like me its Im okay if they dont,1.0,73
Hes right Ive always loved studying the gestures and language of appealing characters and I come across as confident most of the times to the point where people are surprised when I tell them I have anxieties and various inner struggles like we all do Its not about feeling perfect its about knowing you deserve to be where youre at and accepting that you might feel uncomfortable at times,2.0,399
I think fake it till you make it is really important when it comes to confidence You need to practice it in order for it to start coming naturally Appearing confident even when you dont feel confident I believe can prevent confrontation or becoming a victim in some circumstances,2.0,290
Anyone who has seen an infant stare at someone unselfconsciously or do almost anything that infants and pretoddlers do will understand that we are indeed born confident I think fear and inhibition are learned and later have to be unlearned if we are to regain our initial confidence now that we have an intellectual understanding of it,1.0,342
Honestly I feel like confidence comes naturally when you care about something so much that you are no longer sensitive to how people see you and how you appear in front of others Like Jane Goodall or Colin Powell  Im a person that has a mission thats important to me plus huge experience and knowledge that built me and Im proud and what the world thinks is not my concern,2.0,381
confidence can be very quiet  finally someone said it thank you,2.0,68
I was born confident and as a little girl I was constantly scolded for being too bold or outspoken Now I own it again and found joy in life like when I was true to myself,2.0,172
The presenter here delivers his knowledge succinctly He IS the example of what he is teaching Thank you for a concise  no extraneous lesson  It is has been immensely helpful,2.0,178
I have ADHD so usually its hard for me to focus on talks speeches and so on But when someone is really good at speaking and confident about what theyre saying I tend to pay more and even full attention I paid full attention to this video and even remember what I learned after watching only once This is my 2nd time here Just to make sure I dont forget ,2.0,364
To me confidence means being happy with who you are Having that inner peace with the person you are,2.0,101
This guys body language tells me that he is uncomfortable with this interview and that he is withholding information,0.0,118
Hes definitely someone who can make you admit everything just by his personality,2.0,81
An important caveat is that when interviewing anyone you need to establish a baseline for their individual body language Maybe they are naturally more nervous or nervous because of the situation So you first ask questions you already know answers to to see how they react Watch how they move when they tell the truth Figure out their normal Then you can ask calculated questions and see if there is deviation You are looking for clusters of indicators  not isolated indicators,1.0,492
Im glad that those signs he laid out at the beginning were myths Ive put so much effort over the years into avoiding showing these signs by accident so I dont come across as untrustworthy and when I do them by accident I always felt like Im somehow maliciously deceiving people or myself without knowing about it This puts my mind at ease  selfsoothing if you will,2.0,376
Love that he first mentioned crossing arms and looking away I cross my arms often to relieve anxiety and I usually tend to look away when being explained something because Im visually processing information they tell me,1.0,222
god his children mustve had such a hard time lying to him,0.0,58
The guy is giving a simplified summary for total beginners and people think it is an exact account if the methods they use Agents have spoken with innocent and guilty people their knew how to account for simple nerves and a guilty person They know how to establish a baseline to account for individual traits And most importantly none of this can be used too convict you They cant just say yep hes the murderer he is lying and throw you in prison It is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too or who they should focus on They still need to investigate and find actual  PROOFV to convict you If you didnt do it they cant convict you just because you seemed like you were lying,0.0,755
I remember I was in an argument with a friend if mine and I crossed my arms She instantly called me out on it and said if Im being open and honest then why did I cross my arms Thats a defensive stance Later I found out that this was meant and a self sooth which I find more realistic That situation was stressful for me so crossing my arms made sense I do that when Im anxious or upset,1.0,391
This is the most interesting thing Ive seen in a long time I can feel this guys passion and attention to detail The way he described seeing pertinent nonverbals jumping out at you as if a caricature when played at double speed was INCREDIBLY perceptive Im so intensely interested in this individual and his affinity to human behavior,2.0,340

I love what Camielle said about french girls finding what suits them their body and what they like and dressing according to that Not following trends but buying staple pieces that will fit your wardrobe and last a long time I really love that Fast fashion has ruined our sense of style Some people only buy a piece because its trendy then the trend passes and they forget about that item and throw it out and the cycle continues with the next trend,2.0,461

Thank you so much for the talk",2.0,130
This is hands down one of best talks I have heard Thanks for such a wonderful lesson,2.0,86
"Well I have finished watching it and I found it really useful Here are some lessons I learnt
I dont have time  It is not a priority
Time is a choice it is elastic
We have enough time almost all of us Make the experiences enjoyable such as you can read or listen to a book while commuting 

Get rid of things that take away most of your time on a daily basis 

Focus on what matters and you will build the live you want",2.0,439
Make yourself a threecategory priority list for the coming week career relationships self and there should be 23 items in each category small moments can have great power you can use your bits of time for bits of joy Even if we are busy we have time for what matters quoting her,2.0,289
"We are so obsessed with time just like someone already said in the comments But on the other hand we will always find time for the things that truly matter to us and thats what Laura Vanderkam says in her talk
I used to rush myself on the bike to school and I love cycling but I wanted to be there as fast as possible so that Id have more time to study Yet every time I would rush through Id be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me making me feel frustrated with the time I was wasting waiting at the red lights All I was left with was more sweat frustration and muscle pain So I decided this was not going to do it Now I cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature the rain the sunshine the wind the smells of life everything listening to the city or the birds I even have time to stop if I see a cat and try to give it some snacks I arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day Its my favorite thing to do now 
Making a priority list will make your life better Especially the relationships and self categories Taking time to just be present in the moment and live Ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead 
Or instead of procrastinating by scrolling through Facebook watch a TED talk You wont feel like youve wasted your time after that 
Thanks for the inspiring talk Im getting back to work now Time to review my priority list",1.0,1484
We dont build the lives we want  by saving time We build the lives we want and time saves itself ,2.0,102
Ive had varying work schedules and it was incredibly hard to adjust to night shifts at first mainly because it was hard to find time to hang out with friends and family This video has taught me that priorities can change They might take some getting used to but it showed me that a night job doesnt have to mean no social life,1.0,332
 Every minute I spend is my choice  how great is this sentence,2.0,64
I like her approach and Its partly right but I do believe that the things that we want to do during the week could be postponed for other reasons too and not only because we dont count them as priorities For example  its not the same having free time in the morning and having free time at 2300 The opportunities for doing certain things are less kids are in bed shops are closed etc Also when you want to meet other people you need to find some hours in which you are both free and its not super easy to happen,1.0,524
I love this womans attitude Shes funny captivating and interesting too For me step 1 of controlling my time would be to stop watching YouTube though,2.0,157
"I know at least 5 ways to deal with them

1 Never take their words personally Always have this suspicion in mind that they do not wish good for you so you shouldnt trust their opinion of you
2 Dont compete with them It is futile and drains your energy
3 If they attack you stay calm indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment The odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative
4 Dont become them If they are negative be positive If they lie tell the truth If they speak behind your back speak to their face Always lead with example because they might not simply have the skills to do that
5 Do not trust them Dont tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you Keep your distance and value your boundaries Protect yourself",0.0,903
You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you  True power is sitting back and observing things with logic  True power is restraint  If words control you that means everyone else can control you  Breathe and allow things to pass,1.0,283
"Repeat after me

Its safe to set boundaries with difficult people
No matter what they say or feel I am safe",2.0,112
This only works if all people involved are reasonable If one or more parties cant be reasoned with then the problem continues You can communicate until youre blue in the face but if the other person isnt willing to communicate appropriately then youve hit a brick wall,0.0,278
"Their bad behavior shouldnt be the cause of your heartattack
Brilliant",0.0,76
"Long story short keep the convo brief simple cool calm and level headed Only give one word answers than a full sentence Dont give them the benefit of the doubt Be the bigger person and do yourself a favour and save yourself from that heartache 

Trust me when I say this it works every time Giving them a reason to whine and complain and talk about said drama only repeats itself if you give them the time and energy to do it When they get less of that well the difficulty becomes easier to manage ",1.0,511
Cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level People who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view Someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be dealt with by affecting what matters most to them money Unfortunately office sociopaths who gaslight daily rarely get reprimanded They have everyone else in the office convinced they are wonderful and that you are the problem Best solution is to remove yourself from that environment,0.0,484
I swear I need this to deal with my whole family ,1.0,49
This puts a whole new perspective on the way I think about others actions and my reactions I cant change people but I can change the way I think and feel And also asking questions is another good point very well said,2.0,221

I would like to argue that declaring you quit the death game and that the girlfriend can save herself is perhaps the worst way to test the game master in that situation Yes figuring out a way to determine why the game master is helping you is a good idea but if the only reason theyre helping you is because theyre impressed with your selflessnesswillingness to risk your life to save hersthey have a connection to the girlfriend then say goodbye to your main advantage in this game Im not sure if there is a good way to definitively figure out their motivations in one declarationaction but you could run some tests over time to see which actions get rewarded and make more declarations as to your own motivations to see if that has any effect but make them less obvious and less likely to cause the game master to completely abandon you,1.0,854

i love how in the triangle room game instead of just ignoring the dumbest person in the room they used his imagination and creativity to figure out the solution,2.0,160
For the platform game just have each person make a prolonged sound while slowly going and laying down on the platform That way you can easily tell if theres a wall between you and them by whether the sound changes ,1.0,220
2152 Im pretty sure that wouldnt be enough to destroy his plan If lets say one of the three people with the wall managed to answer the question correctly thats still 2 options eliminated And with how fast Shirube came up with his  first plan he had more than enough time to devise a second test to figure which of the remaining two directions was the correct one,1.0,372
For the platform game I think the second go was almost perfect If he found a way to obscure his hands and ask a loaded question then it wouldve been foolproof Like if he kept a coin and hid it somewhere on his person then asked everyone which hand held the coin Thats not a perfect solution but thats the kind of question Im thinking of One where if you choose an obvious answer you know theyre lying and the only one telling the truth would give you a third answer,1.0,479
In the platform game what if the guy asked the other people to go to the corner of the edge of the platform and reach their hand out so he can grab it Since theres only a small opening in the center they wouldnt be able to do it and the distance seems to be close enough for this to work,1.0,294
This guys definetly a genius,2.0,30
For the spinning platform I have an easier solution once you see which way is safe to jump and they put the mask on put your hand on one of the corners of the platform while facing the safe area now when the platform rotates count how many turns it has made by feeling with your free hand the position of your hand on the corner being able to count how many rotations made gives you the idea of where you are and where to jump,1.0,430
As for the spinning jump game the voices from the people behind the wall will have less compare to the voice without the wall With that alone it will be very easy to figure out,1.0,179

My thing has been the shifting of schedules to match my chronotype Just the violence of waking up at 6h30 was unbearable for me And when I went to college and picked classes that started at 10 at the earliest it was a game changer I am not sleeping more hours maybe less hours even because college but I am never truly tired anymore,0.0,343

I really believe in everything he has just said It is important to avoid procrastination guys I am telling you this because of my life experience I moved to Canada when I was 20 years old and my life has changed completely I was studying computer engineering in my home country and was about to complete my 3rd year when my mother took the decision to move to Canada It was really difficult at the beginning because of the language and culture My knowledge about English was probably between 30 and 45 so I had to invest part of time studying English  I proposed to myself that I had to learn the language  at a university level  in 1 year and it worked I still need improvements but I feel really proud of myself because I was able to learn the language After having learned English I applied to University of Toronto to study Computer Science  and since the semester was going to start on September of the following year I took that year to study everything about my career I took my time to study advanced functions calculus physics and programming What do I mean about all of this You can learn everything you want if you really want to The crucial part of all of this is to believe that you can do it I personally do not believe in what the science says about the SPECIAL KIDS We all are smart beings that have the same capacities to learn everything we want You can do it guys if you are willing to take the effort I hope you have a great day and I wish you all the best  NEVER GIVE UP,1.0,1522

Hi just want to say that many times ruminating is emotionally driven there can be an uncomfortable feeling and our mind jumps in to try to either make us feel better or dwell on that feeling and feed more into it  So shifting from our mind and into our body sensations can actually be really helpful and grounding and even illuminating  When we ignore our feelings our body often starts shouting at us to get our attention so just listening to what our body is saying acknowledging the feelings and fears can be very clarifying and soothing,1.0,547

Very little is needed to make a happy life it is all within yourself in your way of thinking  Marcus Aurelius Meditations,2.0,127
"The biggest thing Ive realized lately is that the more money you have the more money you will want to spend
So you never really feel like you have enough
Thats why I really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have
This is especially true of us in the first world
We get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff that they are living the dream
But the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles
And if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach

The irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most
They have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need
So when they come to live here and get a job they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff
Their family back home wonder why they are so stingy in sending money
But the family doesnt realize that the cost of living is much higher where we live
You never feel like you have enough",2.0,1358

Im an engineer and I work with batteries as a hobby There are two kinds of batteries that are LiON One is protected and the other is unprotected 

The protected ones prevent overcharging and overdischarging as well as over current The unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection Guess which people choose for their vaping 

Lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density They are damaged by over charging and over discharging Cheap chargers dont behave and will over charge Few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge 

So why dont people use protected cells  Generally those have too low current to make vaping possible The current draw to instantly heat to 200C is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in causing things to not work or work much more slowly",2.0,900

"To summarize the CODE for building the 2nd brain
C  Capture use notetaking apps or picture to store information
O  Organise ask Where will I use this information
D  Distill progressive summarization
E  Express show your work",1.0,238
"SUMMARY NOTES
0000 Intro
The problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information

The second brain system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information

The second brain system has helped Ali in his own life and can hopefully help others as well

The second brain system uses CODE as an acronym to explain its core foundations  Capture Organize Distill Express

0041 What is a Second Brain and why should you have one
 A second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas

 Building a second brain can help you express your creativity be more productive and make better decisions 

 Every job today involves knowledge work of some kind and a second brain can help you with inputting processing and outputting information

 The methodology for building a second brain has four parts Capture Organize Distill and Express CODE

0456 C Capture
 Ali discusses different ways of capturing information both manually and automatically

Ali captures his thoughts and ideas in Apple Notes

 He also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books articles and podcasts

 Having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything

 Ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day as well as highlights from books articles and podcasts

0832 O Organise
 Ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in ones learning

 This means that when you come across something relevant you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take rather than creating a new category for it

 You can still search for specific information using control F or command F if needed

 This system is especially helpful when working on longterm projects with many moving parts

1107 D Distill
 Ali talks about a method called progressive summarization which is basically like highlighting but on steroids

 This is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important

 Different than highlighting were used to in school  its not particularly effective for  retention in your own personal brain but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important

1145 E Express
The E in the second brain system stands for Express meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas you need to share them with the world in some way

Sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback collaborate with others and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work

Without expressing our ideas they are essentially useless  its important to find a way to share your creativity with others

1309 How my Second Brain has helped Ali
The coursebook has helped Ali become more productive but also more creative and less stressed in general

The system taught Ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts  working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one most of the work is already done 

The system has also helped with his teaching work  he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information",2.0,3474
I am eagerly waiting for Alis first TED Talk It would be amazing I wonder what topic he will speak on,2.0,108
Having a second brain is no joke I am currently using notion to perfect this Great video Ali Definetly devouring all of the information you are putting out ,2.0,160
Now this is my favourite video I have been struggling a lot when it comes to handling multiple projects  Thanks Ali You really answered a lot of my questions today,2.0,169
Im so happy about this book Im reading it right now Am on page 90 and its already changing my digital life Thank you Tiago Forte ,2.0,137
"Thanks for this Ali and Team It really helps break down the process of thinking to have a 2nd brain Ive been calmer with my projects since listening to you and I grow ever more productive with my schedule and life in general

As for the video idea perhaps you can make a video on how to deal with burn outs I believe burnouts burn creativity You want to push but you just mentally cant Ive dealt with it in the past but Im getting out of it now since the company I want to work for actually hit me up to work with them It gave me a boost",2.0,551
Your Book Club series is one of the most useful series on YouTube I have a commonplace book in Evernote and Im always amazed at the gems Ive come across over the years You spinning around by a hot tub when you were talking about selfcare is such a vibe Love the idea of organising ideas according to actionability Felt called out by hoarding your ideas Thank you for this breakdown of the book Ali Noted as a must read and I also need to work expressing my finds,2.0,475

To absorb what one reads its crucial to master concentration When I started reading in my early youth my mind would wander before finishing a page Over time my concentration improved to a point where I could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought Activities like chess reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration I know a Buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment Its a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline Its literally rewired his brain Schools fail miserably in teaching our youth in the art of self learning,2.0,634
I was born into a relatively poor family  Never had the opportunity to go to college  I became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school  I happened to live in a town that had one of the top 10 business schools in the US  I would go to the University library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught  within 18 months I had the knowledge of an MBA  By the time I was 20 I started my own company and was a millionaire before I turned 40  It took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you  I finally found a banker that would talk to me  I explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money I would borrow he was floored,2.0,812
Be a teacher but forever a student Listening in itself is a lost art So difficult to run across a good listener Joe Rogan comes to mind I really enjoy the interviews he has conducted with Elon as his guest I dont necessarily agree with Elon on many things but he seems sincere and takes his time trying to explain his thoughts What I like about Joe is he gives his guests time to speak without interrupting them with his own beliefs  or agenda like so many on the tell a vision  Being a good listener takes practice but well worth the effort,2.0,553

Everybody you can take any variety of quinoa from the store meant to be cooked and plant the seeds I have done this in California many times and have grown several varieties of quinoa It takes a small field to get enough to sell but a few plants will give you a few cups of dried grain you can cook for a few meals and some seed to save for next year and the leaves are edible too and can be cooked like spinach The next time you go shopping at a store that sells quinoa plant a few of the grains You can even grow it as a houseplant but beware it grows several feet tall and wide and is prone to falling over when the flowers get heavy If you try to grow this plant just pause this video and look at the ground they are growing it in It likes to grow in a mixture of compacted dirt crumbled rock and sand in a very hot place where its occasionally watered Thats what you wanna put in your flower pot and reproduce Mine grew well in a place where there used to be a gravel walkway that had been overgrown with thistles and nothing else for years Please grow your own quinoa even if just for fun It would be a cool school science project to do with kids the stuff is like a weed and grows in conditions other food sources do not,1.0,1245

If you are going to start a vending business giving customers the option to use cards will increase your sales a ton Fewer people carry cash especially in small denominations The customer with larger bills will not use your machines until they break their bill at another retailer Which will likely have snacks and drinks at their POS for impulse purchases,1.0,362

Although I disagree about some other business models generalizations For example on affiliate marketing nobody says you get paid once its an option theres revenue sharing pay per sale etc

From dropshipping you can also get recurring with monthly kits or other types of products that have a smaller life cycle costumer
The margins game is highly variable and thats where some people get ahead of others

Love the breakdown I started my first business from money I made off dividends With what Ive learned over a decade investing given enough time solid investments have the potential to double the initial principal amount but many investors are instead attracted to the lure of high yields in short periods of time despite the possibility of unattractive losses before even getting out So the onus is on newbies to beware Having multiple income streams helped me stay afloat in business when the pandemic broke out,2.0,520

Its touching to hear Elon talk about wanting to bridge a gap between the genetically unfortunate with intelligence augmentation My mother has a hereditary severe brain disease that affected her life  disabled her The impact of her brain health affected my developmentlife and my brain health The genetic component also affected my brain health Currently Im functionally disabled from it too Its a constant chronic hell cycle Its comforting to know someone out there as dedicated and capable as Elon Musk is thinking about disadvantaged people like my mother  I,1.0,574

Ive been dreaming of opening a coffee shop in my neighborhood over the last 2 years We moved to a brand new neighborhood without much comercial options within 4 miles I keep telling people I know I dream of this and the associate pastor at my church said I should pitch them putting up a pop up stand in the church I was amazed that they trust me enough to do that but at the same time Im scared to start even though I have a lot of support at church and friends 

One of my friends owns a coffee shop already on the other side of town and is willing to get me in front of the right people But again my family is relying on my income to live I know it would be great I just need to find a person I trust to help run it along side with me so I can maintain my insurance career at the same time since its not demanding at all",2.0,860

It makes sense  BTC and crypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere  Most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize   The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 7 btc and 15ETH from daytrade with Leroy Davids Crypto in few weeks,1.0,644
As you can see we are already in August and I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just nave the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions Id say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 92 BTC when I started at 35 BTC  in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from LIBERTON CORP would advise yall to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you arent sure about,2.0,714
Although I have interests in global economics I dont watch the news anymore I have enough FUD  Thanks for this news and offering your insight on how to navigate during unfortunate timesevents like this  Youre right about keeping level headed when investing so thats why I think its important to limit the amount of FUD we consume  I dont watch the media but the news that you present has enough to know issues going on without riding the emotional rollercoaster if I were to watch the news everyday  Now I buy and just trade long term more than ever I have made over 728k from day trading with Liberton Corp Signal in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,1.0,724
LIBERTONCORP is young  Holding almost anything mentioned here is a good hold because the VHS or Beta will only show in time  I want to hold them early  Its sad that most dont think of these things as good future holds instead of being out of the market and bottom hunting  Are we the adopters or are we scavengers  surely one of these layer ones will become the standard and i dont want to sell any of them too early,1.0,422
I sincerely appreciate the work youve done and the knowledge you share Technical analysis can be helpful but I think It is quite puzzling that wellknown cryptocurrency YouTubers just pay attention to pure TA and entirely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is inflating and why the outlook for the future is even more encouraging than it seems Ignoring the reality that each ETF launch to this point has caused a sizable decline from BTC highs is somewhat dangerous We were already in a perilous position and only survived a protracted bear market due to historically low volume and nearly  whale pumps Day trading should be given greater consideration because it is less affected by the markets situation  trading daily with LIBERTONCORP I have earned over  12BTC using his insights and charts His insight has always been a step ahead of others,1.0,862
When referencing corporate America he said They dont really care about you as they make it seem realest thing he saidIve seen experienced it first hand in the DMV Black ppl arent really respected in corporate America Glad that he was able to get out of there and become his own boss LIBERTONCORP,1.0,306
keep up the great work You are truly an asset to the community Thanks for all you do I like your truthful coverage BTCs price has been fluctuating lately buying isnt a tough call but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable Most people do not understand how the space works Your advantage in understanding chart wont guarantee what an asset is going to do Prices will go up or down Nevertheless the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down Ive always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader LIBERTONCORP  I made 12BTC from this recent crash and despite the ups and down in the market Im still bagging more money,2.0,877
Honestly I appreciate you and your content  Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems Its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market I have made over 35 BTC from day tradng with Liberton Corp insights and charts His been one step ahead of other analysisStick with BTCETHBNBADAMATIC,0.0,812

High fashion is sometimes very abstract very elitist very bizarre and sometimes purely ridiculous But if you push all of the crazy price tags aside and all the ridiculous celebrity endorsers too you find artisans people who study and excel in a craft They deserve to be highlighted more Behind that overpriced Chanel bag is a leatherchainfabric artisan and years of creative thought and passion Fast fashion is slowly killing our planet water consumption landfills toxic chemical dumped in village waters people paid pennies etc haute couture is rare its scarce I find the luxury scene beyond ridiculous but I love my high end pieces that have lasted me years and will continue to do so Behind these fashion shows are artisans that will always be better than any fast producing machine,0.0,808

Luxury fashion is one of the worlds biggest industries I think this is a great topic for a Bloomberg series I would be interested is seeing more of this type of content I am particularly interested in the recent collaboration between Gucci and Balenciaga especially now that I know they both come under the Kering umbrella Other recent collaborations include Versace and Fendi which could be the subject of another video The more recent video in this series examines the Chinese market and how fashion brands are now targeting young Asian consumers,2.0,558
The worst thing to happen to fashion was influencers who encourage always wanting the next instead of appreciating the now and the classic Theyre so fickle and encourage everyone else to be the same,0.0,203
I love how luxury is about preserving the craft and labor of the poor for the rich Like what really is the point here Is it the small artisans who get  and praise or the fashion houses and companies that actually get to design  exploit labor and sell for profit  The definition just isnt strong enough for me to care,0.0,329
I used to love high fashion but the more I learn about what goes on in the industry the more I feel like pursuing a different career choice so much nepotism elitism and lack of creativity its almost as if you dont fit within certain enclaves youre not welcomed,0.0,270
I love the new sustainability efforts excited to see new changes,2.0,66
people are really stuck on the price tags and not understanding that couture is only made to order by experts in their fields thats what this video is looking at These pieces are art and art is different for everyone just because you dont like this version of art doesnt make you better than those who do I could never afford these pieces but that doesnt stop me from really appreciating the vision behind it,1.0,418

"The first thing I want you to knowwhom ever you might be is that God loves you  I dont care what you have done in the past  I dont care of the mistakes you have made   The blunders we all have  He loves you I want you to understand that  Millions have prayed this prayer around the world and now it is your turn  In just a few moments time if you believe it is all God requires believe it  Forget about your past  When they put Jesus in that tomb they put all of your sins in that tomb as well  When Jesus walked out of that tomb He walked out victorious and we came out with Him a new creation in Christ Jesus
I am going to pray and I want you to pray with me  I am going to say the words that you need to say  Saying words cannot save you but if you truly believe in your heart you will be saved And I want you to say them out loud and mean them with all of your heart  And Jesus Christ will come into your heart and change your heart and change your life  
Let us pray

Dear God in Heaven
I come to you
I am sorry for my sins and the way I have lived
The things I have done
Please forgive me
Cleanse me
With your precious blood
From every sin I have ever committed
Right now with my mouth I confess the Lord Jesus
And in my heart I believe that Jesus died for me and rose from the dead
And I accept Jesus Christ this very moment as my savior my redeemer and I make Him the Lord of my life
And right now I am a new creation I am washed I am cleansed I AM SAVED

also does anyone else see spiders in the black and red tericota or nemo fish in the blue orange taracota might be a story telling ability there might be fun to explore",2.0,496

"The minecraft way
Step 1 Build a temporary box house or cave home
Step 2 After playing for awhile and gathering materials prepare to build your new house
Step 3 Look up some builds people have done for their houses for inspiration
Step 4 Realize that to accomplish any of those youll need to get 10x the resources you already have and spend like 10 hours of dedicated building time
Step 5 Stop playing for 8 months
Step 6 Start playing again but feel completely lost and confused as to wtf you were doing
Step 7 Decide to start a new world so you can just start from the start instead of trying to remember everything from your current world
Step 8 Return to step 1",0.0,680

"Just wanna real quick say that if you plan on being really good at building this is NOT the only tutorial you need not even remotely Being an expert at building requires near perfect understanding of the basics ie what they are and how to execute them You need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter often times even understand things like color theory There is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video especially an 8 minute one But as far as guidelines for people who just want a nice house this video is great pretty much everything is spot on and will make things look good almost every time you build it





Also if you want to get really into building I would recommend watching all of Grians tutorials and once youve gotten to a decently advanced level watching tutorials from another far smaller youtuber who goes by Horace  Minecraft he is an amazing content creator and is incredibly talented in his craft in my opinion even better than grian is though they do build in vastly different ways so there isnt much comparison that works there",1.0,1221

The two major nuclear disasters happened because of 1 incompetence Chernobyl and 2 natural disaster Fukushima As a British citizen I would say that on the most part we are very capable of preventing those two things Weve wasted 30 years of nuclear understanding and fine tuning in my opinion lets get those plants running baby,0.0,338
I think anyone who has spent time working in a modern agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant we no longer plan past the next quarter  Supply chain bottleneck is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict cerveza   The system is brittle by design because its so much cheaper that way    Nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos  its a huge engineering lift it takes 20 years to pay itself off you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts machine them weld them then certify and maintain them over a period of 40 years  Instead weve been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home gutting workforces funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain  skill loss as the old timers machinists retire but hey we delivered a lot of value for shareholders   And now the chickens are coming home to roost,0.0,1081
Germany acted foolishly when decommissioning so much nuclear when it was providing so much clean energy Their CO2 emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence Personally I am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer but without the emissions Renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclearfossil fuels I would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants using the same small plots of land With Renewable it requires covering vast amounts of land with solarwind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is windsolar This land should be used for farming or nature preserves not renewables  If the solar is using worthless land such as the desert maybe it makes senses but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaningmaintenance needed due to the dust Offshore wind also resolves the land use problem but the costs of maintaining 100s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high Not to mention ruining the view of ocean front properties,1.0,1280

Nuclear is a great carbonfree base load electricity source Id like to see it not as a competition but rather a companion to renewables in the future electrical generation portfolio On the downside nuclear is expensive to build and insure but the actual watts  generated are among the cheapest There are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors and it seems like well have enough of it for 50100 years if we generate 4050 of the energy from nuclear On top of that thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts Another new direction in nuclear is small modular reactors 4th gen which in theory should be much cheaper to build and run making initial investment lower They would also give us greater agility in planning the electrical grid,1.0,813
So impressed Marko has made a video regarding energy use in the EU It is useful to view the data from just a futures point of view which is how companies plan on future availability  Way to keep up the good work Marko BTW  nuclear energy has been overlooked for the last 30 years and needs to come back It is sad how German and French embraced nuclear energy then pulled back which leaves them open to the crisis now America should take heed,1.0,449
Excellent video Marko Things look really bad for now Just recently it was reported that Germans among many others probably already spend their savings to fight inflation instead of having their salaries rise to cover it I dont want to imagine what will happen in the winter when the energy bills will really increase or when those savings run out,0.0,358
"Great video again Marko you did a great job 

Sadly The Netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos 
In addition I can tell that after the Fukushima nuclear incident in March 2011 the EU banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second Chernobyl incident
The thru regulations Coal was stamped as dirty and Gas was the second best option after Nuclear power

If we go back into history the North European countries the Netherlands also build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages Since there wasnt a need to change and Gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created Now there is need so the Coal and Nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need

From my point of view these things should change
 Nuclear is the way to go
 Create a military security perimeter around Nuclear power plants
 The western world shouldnt be working with Russia nor China for Energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability

Furthermore the ECB cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0 intrest rates the financial unstable countries you call them PIGS Portugal Italy Greece Spain and with this structural inflation problems Russia knows this and the ECB messed up big time

Last but not least the EU but also the USA Canada Australia and Japan need to stop applying QE start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable

Thanks again Marko",2.0,1572
Hi Marko Im living in the Germany not born though and have been following your podcast because you do good analysis  Honestly as a european I feel quite disappointed by everything I understand why the administration decided not to invest in nuclear energy after Fukushima accident but on the other hand I cannot understand how they didnt invest in other resources or should I say how the Europe especially Germany didnt diversify when it comes to energy suppliers Its like you said they just ignored that fact even though we already had a couple of years ago possible no delivery situation with Russia,0.0,619

Barter system is the alternative to money but is highly inefficient 
Money serves as a medium to exchange store of value and a unit of account 
In the past we had the gold standard which connected each dollar to a value of gold
Stock market is part of the Financial system which is composed of Lenders corporations and households and borrowers households businesses governments
Financial system  a network of institutions markets and contracts that brings lenders and borrowers together 
3 ways this happens banks bonds stock market

"Hey Erling Paralegal here I saw the end of your video but would still recommend getting an attorney to help with handling this suit Lawsuits are not fun in any way unless your the attorneyfirm and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress My parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always

Moreover if the other side has an attorney they have the advantage of knowing how the system works such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase Rule 26a dislcosures interrogatories evidence you intend to use at trial depositions of plaintiffs defendants and expert witnesses etc and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge 

I truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself Just be careful with how you proceed Pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done Also remember its a legal system and not a justice system

I appreciate the content you put out on YouTube I enjoy watching your videos  I respect you for applying your experience and knowledge into an investment decision and putting your neck on the line by making it public You may be right on this trade but if you are right you better also short the US market as well Because if the Chinese market collapses it will pull down the US market with it Thanks Buddy Previously Bitcoin has been fluctuating between the 20K and 25K price marks Billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price particularly in the last four weeks The loss has become the primary cause of several firms liquidation issues in the crypto industry I think the direction is upward movement with a bit of silence before the storm agree its boring for the past few days a good strategy for hoddlerss moving forward would be to buy now and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn the rise will surprise everyone As for traders you make money anyways in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions If youre a modern investor then your main aim I guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility Well goodnews you dont have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with Mrs Robin Moore and the rest will be a good history of profits for you I have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 1703 BTC with 507 BTC with her trade signal despite the state of the market Her trade signal yield a lot of dividend only if you are paying attention to her instructions The good thing of this strategy is that whatever happens we have an opportunity to make some money trading with it not minding the sideways in the crypto market For HelpGuidance on buildinginvestingfinancial portfolio eIm  moorerobin ,2.0,1983

"I watch your videos for your real talks and you never disappoint Keep going Youve reminded me of what someone once said The mind is the man the poor is in it and the rich is it too This sentence is the secret of most successful investors I once attended similar and ever since then I have been waxing strong financially and I most tell you the truth The bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month They have managed to push the price by more than 100 The majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical 2K level One thing is certain nobody knows what is going on Our leadership in the country couldnt be any worse from the press to the feds they are all terrible They say you cant time the market but this one was easy to see coming Every man  woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance Doesnt matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check  checks ASAP Thats the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains Its unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation things has been so difficult but BTCETH trading has helped me maintain financial stability Although I believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why I made huge profits with the help of Mr James Wilson he is a genius and that is why I always advise beginnersinvestors to trade with professionals like him So far I have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from 107 btc to atop 1301 btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by James and Im an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy You all in search of a way to recover your looses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to him for mentorship and profitable trading system on eIm Jameswilson21   Cheers thank me later

Great content I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just nave the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions Id say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 102 BTC when I started at 35 BTC  in just few weeks copying and implementing trades with signals and insights from  Feven Lena I would advise yall to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you arent sure about,2.0,700

Thank you for your videos mateits normal to see so many investors panic amid a worsening bearish market but it is also important to note that the market situation is nothing new in the crypto world Several factors are driving negative sentiment in the stock and crypto markets right now including inflation a shaky stock market rising interest rates and recession fears As a result bitcoin has dropped significantly from its alltime high breaking below several key technical levels As a crypto investor the current situation might seem bleak However there are several tried and tested expertsuggested investment strategies that can help you accumulate the current crypto storm in few weeks of implementing trading with accurate signals directly from Mr Ryan Donald I have been able to accumulate over 11 btc despite the current state of the market,0.0,863

I think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a DEPRESSION so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ATHs Great points in your video I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to SPNasdaq and Altcoins to BTC Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom That short term thinking is such a rookie mistake By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guess work out Next bull run it wont be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low Im really holding on for this possible low point reentry I screwed up some time back  i need this lower point to get back in ive small cash on the sideline I dont like that but i refuse to fomo in Our younger investors are scared theyre concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before My advise to them is this go all out into trading Trading is where the bucks are been made I see the stock market housing values going down and crypto going up Traditional markets are getting recked The new economy is crypto not fiat People want truth not corruption contracts not monetary easing Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor Mrs Robin Moore With her guides and trade signal i use in trading i have moved from having 58 btc to atop 173 btc in a short period of time Invest today and trade your crypto assets with the best tutor trader eIm moorerobin or Whatsapp 12132627458 for more info or mentorship on how to invest trade and earn with her top notch trade signal ,1.0,1910
"High inflation was never a reason to sellThe definition of inflation is that prices go up versus fiat essentially Logically that would make sense even for stocks but especially for a commodity thats been known for many years as an inflation hedge My growing love for crypto caused me to explore until I came across Alice Marcella although Im trying to avoid sensationalism Alice is by far the best No hype for hypes sake but great inspiration to trade Crypto

It makes sense  BTC and crypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere  Most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize   The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 12 btc from daytrade with Axel William Crypto in few weeks,1.0,636

Great video and some nice tips This is a scary time for new investors but the best thing you can do is not to make decisions based on emotions This could actually be a good time to buy more of your high conviction stocks or crypto on a discount Wealth is created during bear markets not bull markets If your portfolio is really effecting your mental health then delete the app and go for a walk Let the market do its thing and have a long time horizon I buy and just trade long term more than ever I have made over 19 btc from day trading with  Karen Gauvin  in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,2.0,658

 first got into BTC back in 2016 and have been hodlingbuying assets at different price points since  Ive been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future  Volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play  I dont have any Alts as Im a bit of a BTC Maxi but that said if BTC hasnt died before it surely wont do so now  Stick in there  yes we are all feeling the pain but over the long run this will just be a blip  This is how I see past corrections when I felt that I got in at a high back then I think it was less than 1000 and bouncing all over the place  Now when I look back all I see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times But if you believe BTC has value then by all means buy the dips if you can afford to  For those who got in at 60 or 70K and feeling the crunch  hang in there  BTC is not a get rich quick scheme  Wait it out and you will see  you will come away stronger  I buy and just trade long term more than ever I have made over 11 btc with 31btc in just 5weeks from day trading with WTRADE INSPECTS  in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,1.0,1222

 I totally agree with what you are sayingThe fact is BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose others are being patient it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals i would say trading has been going smoothly for me i started with 25 BTC and i have accumulated over 116 BTC in just three weeks with the trading strategy given to me by WTRADE INSPECTS,1.0,777

Blockchain backer in the senario you describe are you expecting all time highs for alts or are you expecting to just take some money out when it goes up a bit more during wave 5,1.0,180
Awesome video BCB Thank you But What does wave 5 in the stock market mean for the alt coin market  Would we have enough time for ETH to finish that fractal you mentioned the beginning of the super cycle  Also the merge is coming in a few weeks Is Bitcoin going up to 40k considered a retracement that we need for the alt coin season we all want ,2.0,353

I think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a DEPRESSION so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ATHs Great points in your video I agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think BTC is perfectly correlated to SPNasdaq and Altcoins to BTC Refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective So many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom That shortterm thinking is such a rookie mistake By dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guesswork out Next bull runs it wont be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k What will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low Im really holding on for this possible low point reentry I screwed up some time back  I need this lower point to get back in Ive small cash on the sideline I dont like that but I refuse to FOMO in Our younger investors are scared theyre concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before My advice to them is this go all out into trading Trading is where the bucks are been made I see the stock market housing values going down and crypto going up Traditional markets are getting recked The new economy is crypto not fiat People want truth not corruption contracts not monetary easing Venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment Advisor MrKyle Miller With his guides and the trade signal I use in trading I have moved from having 58 BTC to atop 173 BTC in a short period of time Invest today and trade your crypto assets with the best tutor trader eIm KyleMiller3 for more info or mentorship on how to invest trade and earn with his topnotch trade signal,2.0,1883

Probably what they know is that prices for all cryptos are incredibly low right now and its a great time to buy  Instead of being filled with angst and fear they are showing a little courage and going ahead and stacking up their bags at a time when it makes a lot of sense to do so  I think people need to stop being so fearful  Now is the time to BUY  That should be pretty clear by now Anyone whos shorting and selling and worrying about whether the bottom is in etc doesnt really know what theyre doing,1.0,516

Trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors Its a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries For investors whats probably most attractive is the possibility of lifechanging returns Dont worry youre not late to the crypto party Were likely still in the very early innings leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market If youre new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert I have learned from alot of Youtubers especially my mentor Gerard McDonald who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to 19 btc lately,2.0,725

Honestly I appreciate you and your content  Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems Its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with WTRADE INSPECTS insights and charts They been one step ahead of other analysis,0.0,780
Thanks for the update I always appreciate the insight Im really blown away by the fact that having watched your videos for so long I had the same opinion that you are putting forth in this video In as much I would like to add to what you have said here the market is in a tug of war with the bull at one side and the bears at the other end If this is really a bear market rally then Bitcoin is not done going down just like stocks are not done going down And if this isnt a bear market rally and the Fed achieves a soft landing Bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now but we just have to wait and see  My hope is that by the fourth quarter the economy will be slowing enough that the Fed says we are going to pause and then you will see the next crypto cycle start I have witnessed the last 3 cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now Bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed IMO Please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions Despite the volatility that has ruled the market this year being a retail trader in the crypto market and implementing strategiessignals from Eddie Crypto a professional brokertradr that has been my mentor I have accumulated 12 btc in profits although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits people who are open to learning from history will survive Its not that difficult You can reach out to Mr Eddie on eIm his personal handle is  Edcrypto8 or Whatsapp18053284321,2.0,1617

Ccrypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into  the stratosphere  Most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial  Few if any rug pulls  The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 16 btc from daytrade with WTRADE INSPECTS in few weeks,1.0,713

Trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors Its a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries For investors whats probably most attractive is the possibility of lifechanging returns Dont worry youre not late to the crypto party Were likely still in the very early innings leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market If youre new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert I have learned from alot of Youtubers especially my mentor Gerard McDonald who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to 19 btc lately,2.0,725

Honestly I appreciate you and your content  Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems Its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with Kerry Pickett insights and chartsHis been one step ahead of other analysis,0.0,774
I sincerely appreciate  the knowledge you share If you have been closely watching the crypto or even invested in it chances are that you are wondering whether the latest bear cycle is over The truth is that the market remains unpredictable especially in the longterm Despite the heavy outflows Bitcoin still managed to promptly recover this recovery demonstrated Bitcoins strength despite being stress tested against highly volatile and unfavorable market conditions Could this outcome be a sign that the market is ready for a bigger recovery The obvious answers is yes despite how long it might take it is very important to stay ahead of the market by trading with the right strategy I have been trading with Boston Webers signals and strategy for 3 weeks which I have been able to accumulate 108 btc with his signals Hes a trader i believe everyone else can also work it,2.0,891
Money is an issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life life was really hell for me until i got into crypto investment since 2016 and am actually glad i started crypto when I did because its been a turning point for me financially i cant ever regret making the greatest move that has changed my life financially today,2.0,335

Crypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into  the stratosphere  Most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial  Few if any rug pulls  The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 16 btc from daytrade with Axel William Crypto in few weeks,1.0,714
Thanks for all you do I like your truthful coverage Mad respect for educating everyone BTCs price has been fluctuating lately but I think we should be educating the newbies on what to do aside holding rather than discussing about the dip The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades making profits from trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable Most people do not understand how the space works Your advantage is understanding Charts wont guarantee what an asset is going to do Prices will go up or down Nevertheless the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down Ive always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader   Ruby Benally  I made 85 BTC from the recent crash in the market within a period of five weeks,2.0,869

So I started out with a rubiks speed 3x3 when they were decent for beginners and not louder than an f1 car but it didnt last very long I corner cut too much and the entire thing exploded and some of the pieces went missing

Then for christmas I got a QiYi megaminx that I still havent learned how to solve

Then my friend gave me a tiled rubiks 3x3 this was the cube that I leaned to solve on

Then I got a MoYu WeiLong WR Im getting an SCS CornerEdge magnet set and a cornercore magnet set you can get from the cubicle its a good cube and until christmas it will probably be my main and depending it my stay as my main longer than that",1.0,714

I really appreciate you covering the colorblind aspect I have to have grey instead of green and black instead of orange on my cubes because of my color deficiency and it means significantly less choice in cubes Its very frustraiting,0.0,236
"It would actually be nice to have stickerless cubes reproducing the scheme of stickered cubes with black lines around the pieces This is the reason why I prefer stickered cubes the alternance between colors and black kind of like shadows make each piece stand out more and you get this really cool 3D aspect like you can really tell each piece is a small cube in itself which with a stickerless cube is just not possible it just seems like one big cube Do you know what I mean

Edit I guess what I wanted to say in a few words is that stickerless cubes visually have a lack of depth which I dont really like",2.0,618
What I find good about stickerless is that you can be almost 100 sure that if youre buying a stickerless cube it will turn at least halfdecent while on stickered you may run into unfilleted cubes that require wrist rotations like the Original Rubiks series Of course you always look closely at what youre buying but it just seems like an interesting little detail to think about ,2.0,393

"I have always used stickerless cubes from when I learned all through now  One day a friend and I swapped cubes to see how our times got affected by using each other cubes I like my cubes fast he likes them slower  His main was a stickered cube  Not only was I turning bad because the cube was slower then I was use to but the stickers felt so WEIRD

I just cant use stickered cubes because of the edge on the sticker",0.0,426
I prefer stickered on 3x3 because I love the look Any bigger cubes the amount of stickers just makes it not worth it to me to many that can get damaged and replacing stickers gets exponentially more annoying I would probably feel differently if the stickers from SpeedCubeShop werent as good as they are so I would still take a stickered 3x3 over a stickerless given the option,0.0,387

"How To Solve the Rubiks Cube FASTER  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvmeleO65BHc

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE COMMENTING

I try to reply often but I dont get step X or it doesnt work is too unspecific and I cant help unless I know exactly what problem you have


MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE 4 MOVES
152 has the 4 moves and you have to be able to do this to understand what 4 moves means when I use it again later on

COMMON FIRST LAYER PROBLEMS
Step 1  2 If the side colors of the cross or first layer dont line up the way I showed it in the video then you need to redo it Pay attention to ALL of the colors on one piece and dont just pick white pieces randomly I talk about this in the video how Im trying to match the other colors of the white piece like whiteorange etc

TAKING PIECES OUT OF THE SECOND LAYER
Step 3 At 533 I say you should already know how to do this I admit this is unclear You should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer If this does not make sense watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment

COMMON TOP LAYER PROBLEMS
Step 4 If you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross you need to reassemble the cube as solved
Step 5 There should be no problems here
Step 6 If you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location you need to reassemble the cube as solved
Step 7 Finish the 4 moves dont stop at 3 every time Turn the bottom dont rotate the whole cube to get the next piece If it STILL does not work you need to reassemble the cube as solved

Why do I need to reassemble the cube
Randomly assembling the cube only has a 112 chance of being solvable If youve ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces then that can be the problem If stickers have been switched you will have to switch them back

Emils perspective is a classic example of the fallacy of zero sum thinking where shallow thinkers believe that when one side wins the other necessarily losses  Of course when it comes to things like chess this kind of thinking is completely erroneous and on the contrary when one side wins both sides win  what is good for one aspect of chess is broadly speaking good for chess as a whole  We should be doing everything possible to broaden chesss appeal garner additional exposure and grow its global popularity and online chess obviously plays an enormous role in that process  What is good for online chess is also good for OTB chess  FIDE and other large bureaucratic institutions will hopefully eventually recognize and embrace this too,1.0,760

I think the point Gotham is making especially with the Ruy Lopez Sicilian is that openings of that caliber require such precision and accurate play that unless youre willing to really spend a lot of time with minute details and study youre going to play them wrong Even if you win games with them itll be in spite of your opening not because of it generally speaking Hes clearly talking about beginner intermediate caliber players chess purists can relax,1.0,471

Im pretty sure this wasnt actually the case but it almost looked like Magnus made a bet maybe with himself that he could make X number of moves with his queen and y number of moves with his king and still win or maybe just still reach move 30  That would explain both his laughter and generally humorous demeanor and amateurlike play  This might be considered some innocent type of trolling or even an inside joke but I suspect that if something akin or analogous to this had occurred in the NBA or NFL or MLB some persons would be calling for an investigation  Just looking for a hypothesis that would account for what occurred in game one of the Carlsen Firouzja match  Note how strangely Carlsen played in game four was it of his match with Pragg  I dont know how much Las Vegas type betting goes on with respect to the world of chess but a game like this could make someone who put money on the game very unhappy  In some ways it was embarrassing to watch  I dont believe that type of behavior advanced the cause of pro chess,1.0,1061
Everyone was so worried about him Magnus not taking it seriously When he showed clearly it didnt matter how you look during a match The board speaks for itself TO MY FELLOW CHESS PLAYERSPLAY THE BOARD NOT THE PERSON Also If they didnt want anyone expressing theyre facial expressions and such they would have made the tournament traditional and face to face This chess society has so much to improve on when it comes to JUST PLAYING THE BOARD The point of this game is whose mind is stronger Who ever has the advantage in the META wins always WAKE UP CHESS WORLD,1.0,579

Bishops can move diagonally as far as it wants as long as there is no pieces in the way of it 
Knights the only piece that can jump other pieces and can move in the shape of an L 
King can only move 1 time in any direction is known as the most Important piece but also the most useless 
Queen can move as far as she wants in any direction as long as theres not a piece blocking her small edit she is also known as the strongest piece on the board
Pawns Pawns can move forwards 2 times on the first turn but only once after that on following turns and can only kill moving diagonally forward if the pawn reaches the opponents side of the board you can substitute it for any of your former pieces lost ie if you lost the queen you could bring the queen back by getting a pawn to the opponents side

Honestly I appreciate you and your content  Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems Its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with WTRADE INSPECTS insights and charts They been one step ahead of other analysis,0.0,780
Ccrypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen  The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into  the stratosphere  Most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial  Few if any rug pulls  The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space Id get involved more knowing that I have made over 16 btc from daytrade with WTRADE INSPECTS in few weeks,1.0,713
Thats why Magnus really wanted to face a new generation player in the WCC since he knew they had more chances than the players of his generation Its just like other tournaments even if Magnus loses some games he still won the tournament Looking forward to Praggnanandha an amazing performance for him,2.0,308
Thank you for your videos mateThe BTC shows us that when he wakes up he knows how to do it and destroy all the bears Never go against the trends on cryptos even less put levers it is about the immediate sanction as soon as you turn your back now anyone who has been in the crypto space for the last 6 or more years certainly knows about the cycle structure every 4 yearsBTC goes through a halving even where the amount of Bitcoin that is mined is cut half Well the block reward is cut in half this cause huge price spikes every 4 yrs because it create a supply and demand crisis that cant be priced in until its a reality but all thanks to WTRADE INSPECTS who taught me how to make trade and increased my Crypto from 25 to 10BTC now No one really knows what is going to happen in the market and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own Investment choices based on their own research ,1.0,1000

Pragg continuing to be the comeback king Amazing play he made this tournament extremely exciting was just glued to all his games And Magnus also played really well at the start but I lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely He couldnt even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested The least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because Magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so its not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him rlly left a bitter taste but Im soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring,2.0,1003

Anna love the videos  2 suggestions 1 itd be awesome if you could show the clock somehow Maybe a digital clock that can be synchronized to the video  2 If you or opponent resign a 30 second explanation of why it was resigns at the end would be awesome  In this case I saw your B on a5 was hanging and whites rook defending their e2 bishop  But its not always super easy for us to figure out,2.0,408
Anna took two losses in a row and was laughing and having fun with a strong player Its amazing to watch two pros go neck and neck at each other like this Thank you so much,2.0,175

We keep saying Its the Magnus effect not talking about basketballs and dams here but would be interesting to test this In an esport I follow Age of Empires 2 one player TheViper was so dominant for so long that a streamer T90Official came up with the idea of an event he called Hidden Cup where everyones identities were hidden and only revealed at the end Each player was given a name to play under so nobody knew who was who Was a really interesting concept as there were awesome games and so much speculation over who was who Theyve repeated the format 4 times now which says something about how loved it is But with chess being an online thing now this kind of event is very possible and I think would be fascinating Would Magnus still win TheViper did so proved that theory wrong at least for him,2.0,833

I remember watching an interview with Fischer and he mentioned how during matches even the wrong lighting would throw him off Definitely seems like he might have had sensory issues that werent well understood at the time,0.0,223
Spasky was honestly the mvp of the story with giving into Fischers demands to ensure he got a fair shot to prove his title even though he was being pressured to win at all costs by the soviet union just because he respected him Plus even though Fischer went off grid for like twenty years Spasky was willing to go out of his way to play with him again Then to try and personally protest for his release from prison and even ask to stay in his cell to play chess with him just because he respected his skill so much,1.0,520
My grandfather actually played with Bobby regularly in 1956 at the West Orange Chess Club in New Jersey They played on the same team in interstate tournaments I found some of my Grandpas old letters and its pretty cool He won multiple chess championships some amateur and some professional in the late 40s and early 50s He also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines He was born in 1909 and while I like to think he taught Bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year its likely the 13 year old schooled my grandpa My grandpa quit chess in 1957 to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially chess tournaments didnt pay well back then Though he probably played teenage Bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future If a 13 year old made a multitime champion quit the game entirely he must have been truly special My grandpa could card count so I dont think he had a problem switching to bridge and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career I never got to meet him because he died before I was born Im only 23 I wouldve loved to ask him about Bobby Maybe my mom knows a bit more All I have are letters and a few chess trophies Its very hard to collect information from the early 50s,2.0,1313

The light sensitivity and erratic behavior are symptoms of a person on the spectrum It is not uncommon for people like this to prefer lamps to ceiling lights as the glare is annoying to them Lashing out comes from difficulty communicating feeling different and knowing you are different it is easy to believe that you are being mocked and lacking the skills to compete it is easier to flee than fight Fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess While playing he probably felt safe knowing the rules knowing everyone had to obey them and that he would not be mocked for some social faux pas he didnt understand or care about,0.0,717
"This story should also be a story of Boris Spassky If the information is correct the guy is a really decent person Spassky could repeat could be a world champ without competing but no When Fischer had his ticks Spassky said just give in and lets play Many years later Spassky told then USpresident Bush to Free Spassky and even met Fischer in prison to play chess

I usually switch back and forth yearly between apple and android as I like both fanboy of neither but apple is hitting a peak and really not innovating much anymore Im just going to switch from the 13 pro max to the S22 Ultra As I said I love both but Im not seeing any reasons to upgrade with apple this year If the 15 is a game changer it will be right up my yearly cycle routine switch between both ,2.0,409

I am ready for September 7 Hopefully iOS 16 and watchOS now will come out on Monday the 12th That would be a good release date I find it funny that iPadOS will be delayed a month That is very strange It seems like Apple would just wait until stage manager got fixed and release it with a subsequent update like iPadOS 161 or 1601,2.0,338
Was really hoping the airpods would have some sort of hearing losshearing aid abilities There is a stigma and  pricing on real hearing aids whereas most headphones  phone combos have far more processing and programming abilities to the nerfed offerings from hearing aid manufacturers It would be a massive market to tap into and takeover for whichever phone maker does it first,1.0,390

"Tolles Video 
Schade das sie die Notch nicht lassen bis sie komplett unter dem Display verschwindet
Ist doch eigentlich das Erkennungszeichen vom iPhone
Ich glaube das sie das iPhone Mini alle paar Jahre wieder aktualisiert bringen werden
Da ich erst letztes Jahr beim 13pro Max zugeschlagen habe wird es dieses Jahr wohl ein Update von meinem 2017er iPad Pro 105 werden
Mal schauen was im Oktober kommt 
Gru an alle ",1.0,427
Mein Standpunkt jedes Produkt ohne USBC wird nicht gekauft Beispielsweise htte ich gerne Kopfhrer die AirPods Pro sollen es werden das Geld liegt bereit Durch den LightningAnschluss wren sie schon vor dem Kauf veraltet und ein Fehlkauf Das gleiche gilt auch fr die iPhones Das Ende anderer Anschlsse ist durch die EU eingeleitet und steht fest,1.0,358
Das Highlight wenn es denn berhaupt kommt drfte die Apple Watch Pro werden vor allem beim  Preis  oder die normale Apple Watch im kantigen Design Das neue iPhone ob nun gro oder klein wirkt fr mich persnlich recht unspektakulr Recycling IPhone Pro aus dem Vorjahr gleiches gilt fr die iPhone ProModelle  Ob nun Pille oder Notch  Selbst wenn die Kamera jetzt noch unbelievable wre wrde mir das keine 1200 Euro aus der Geldbrse locken Ich denke es wird auch das letzte iPhone mit einem AChip berhaupt sein Nchstes Jahr wird auch das iPhone auf den MChip umgestellt Meiner Meinung nach lngst berfllig Ich rechne noch fest mit neuen AirPods oder AirPods Pro Interessant drfte sein was mit dem Apple TV passiert  Auch mit der berarbeitung des HomePod Mini rechne ich fest Von einem neuen alten HomePod gehe ich derzeit nicht aus Mich persnlich interessiert nur die neue Watch da bei meine 4er langsam der Akku schlapp macht und Apple nchstes Jahr bei dem 4er Modell den SoftwareHahn endgltig zudrehen wird Das wird vielen so gehen da viele noch das 4er Modell haben und schon seit einem Jahr auf das kantige Design warten Aber eins steht fr mich auch ganz klar fest Kein kantiges Design keine neue Apple Watch  Dann muss die 4er bei mir noch ein Jahr irgendwie weiter berleben ,1.0,1346
Vielleicht bekommt ja der Lightning Anschluss der Iphones ein Speed Update auf USB 3x Das hatten sie auch im letzten Ipad Pro verbaut allerdings damals ein langsamer USB 3 Chip der nur rund die doppelte USB 2 Geschwindigkeit konnte  Also Technisch wre es ja machbar wenn sie wollten Dann wren auch die groen Videos schneller am PCMac,1.0,347
Die Apple Watch 8 wird vermutlich meine erste Apple Watch werden Bin mal gespannt,1.0,83
Ich freue mich natrlich auf den Event und bin wie immer gespannt Was ich aber mit meinem iPhone mache wei ich noch nicht Ich bin mit dem 12er noch immer vollkommen zufrieden und habe ber die vielen vorangegangenen Versionen und Kufe gelernt dass ich eigentlich mit dem neuen iPhone meist genau dasselbe mache wie mit dem vorherigen Eigentlich sollte ich das 12Pro erst ersetzen wenn es entweder kaputt geht oder der Akku am Ende seines Lebens ist beides trifft nicht zu Vermutlich staune ich ber das neue iPhone und vielleicht bin ich neidisch auf schne neue Farben aber dann nehme ich meins aus der Hlle und stelle fest dass mein Oceam Blue auch nicht so bel ist  Zusammengefasst verspre ich keinen Wunsch oder gar Drang ein neues iPhone anzuschaffen und bin mit meinem Happy Vermutlich berspringe ich das 14er auch noch um dann beim 15er zuzuschlagen,1.0,880
Ich werde bestimmt nicht dabei sein  und ich htte auch berhaupt nichts dagegen wenn Apple nur alle 3 Jahre oder so mal ein neues Modell herausbringt Wer braucht alle diese marginalen Verbesserungen Mein altes SE ist immer noch ein sehr gutes Telefon verwaltet Termine und Nachrichten prima und untersttzt die Organisation meines Business ganz hervorragend,1.0,367

"Moin Micha
Dieses Mal hat wohl der Feiertag am Montag ein Event am Dienstag verhindert 
Mal schauen ob eine neue AppleWatch vorgestellt wird die meine Series 1 ersetzen knnte 
Das iPhone interessiert mich in diesem Jahr berhaupt nicht Wenn dann wrde ich nur ein iPhone 14 mini in Erwgung ziehen Ob es eines geben wird  man wei es nicht Lassen wir uns durch die eklige Gerchtekche nicht in die Irre fhren
Denn was ich berhaupt nicht ab kann ist wenn sich selbst ernannte Experten darber aufregen dass sich AppleGerte verspten die berhaupt nicht nicht angekndigt wurden

"Mich interessiert diese mal vor allem das technische Innere der iPhones Beim MacBook Air M2 hat Apple beim kleinsten Speicher lediglich einen einzelnen Baustein verbaut und die Gerte sind deshalb angeblich langsam Falls diese Technik auch bei den iPhones verbaut wird bin ich schon gespannt was drinnen ist
Und zum iPhone Mini
Ich knnte mir vorstellen dass dieses Gert in naher Zukunft als iPhone SE 42024 oder SE 52026 zurckkommt

I know Im in the minority but I love my 13 Mini will be keeping that until it cant go anymore or some huge leap in tech comes Also got a titanium Apple Watch 7 at launch and will be keeping that until we get a HUGE leap in battery tech,2.0,243
I have an iPhone 11 pro that Im completely happy with  Im STILL impressed by the cameras on it beautiful pictures and video  Is there ANY compelling reason for me to upgrade to the 14  Otherwise Ill wait until the 15 with USBC,2.0,237
Ill upgrade when they finally put USBC on next years iPhone,2.0,63
"I feel like getting rid of the mini was a stupid decision on there part I feel a redesigned little bit bigger 14 mini would do really well 
I also see no reason for anyone to upgrade I upgraded from a 12 mini to a regular 13 when I switched carriers I can personally say the phones are nearly Identical in every way If thats any indication of what to expect from the 14 line I would say if you have an 11pro any 12 or 13 model theres not much of a reason to upgrade IOS 16 isnt a design overhaul anything Ill be keeping my iphone 13 for a long time 
The watch saying not to buy one is kinda dumb If you can find a series 6 or 7 buy it especially when you can get a series 7 for around 280340 brand or refurbished from apple Instead of getting the new SE which is essentially a series 6 
I think upgrading the watch or Iphone this year is already a skip
The product to be most excited for is the 10th gen ipad Getting way better features I will def be upgrading my mini 5 to and ipad 10th gen especially since itll have usbc I wish they would do the same with the iphone airpods  apple pencil

My main problem with the M2 Air is that it sits between the M1 air and the 14 MacBook pro Those are two of the best laptops ever made If you can find the M1 Air on sale then it is still an outstanding value If you are paying to upgrade the SSD and RAM then the M2 Air is so close in price to the 14 MacBook pro that if you can spend the little bit extra you will not regret doing so,2.0,391
Been using my M2 MBA for 2 weeks now the best decision I ever made Totally loving the starlight Its fast very light and the battery is definitely powerful I only gotta charge it after 2 days of heavy usage at work,2.0,220

The base model is definitely not future proof with apps and services getting hungrier but an upgraded M2 16512 would be a delightful machine to work on for several years",2.0,252
It would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16 model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz not great but I would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if youre viewing movies It sucks that Apple has made that limitation but is that a limitation on the Thunderbolt or SoC  I feel that the argument that many people dont use a dual monitor setup is not really true especially in the work place My sister uses dual monitors working from home and she uses one of those miniwork towers The thing that tempts me the most about the Air is the weight portability and the amount of power given specific specs its more or less wellrounded However if Im bumping up the storage and unified memory I wouldnt be that far off from the M1 Pro 14 MacBook Pro price Strangely the 14 would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13 nonretina MacBook Pro  The only cool thing about that model is the upgradability but even that is a novelty thats losing its veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to Im hanging onto it as my backup computer Really ought to start saving for a more uptodate laptop The smudging thing is annoying from what I see Its an awesome color but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all Besides the size portability and power not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that Ive yet to experience At work I work with desktop towers and Im used to the noise I suppose,0.0,1567

Thanks for the inside look into the iPhone 14 Pro Max I kind of figured that the hardware would be similar to the 13 Pro Max Hope Apple steps it up with always on display and maybe reverse wireless charging No point in adding a bigger battery if they wont unleash all the capabilities,2.0,289

066 mm larger lenses on iPhone 14 will be a HUGE difference on such small optics That will render much faster speeds and maybe even make room for bigger image sensors or better stabilisation,2.0,195
I think Apple needs to rethink their pricing Im a huge Apple fan but the prices for their products are now just getting rediculous,0.0,135
Im very excited for the future of Apple but as you said the downside is that there are too many products and if Apple doesnt start to focus on their lineup they will just become another tech company lacking what makes Apple products so iconic and better,2.0,257
i wish apple tried something new that samsung did with the galaxy series and that was creating an active rugged phone from the ground up no need for  a case it was a phone that was built to withstand drops and not get dinged up or have glass chipped it offered great grips on the side and i think apple could really hit a good target audience with something like that,2.0,371
The biggest change Apple needs to make is to deal with their ethics issues  That means no longer lying to their customers not abusing them not wallet rping them for profit not gaslighting them  being honest about how private Apple products REALLY are not using decieving marketing etc  That way they might start to get back some of their credibility back At this stage they have a HUGE problem on their hands as they are rapidly gaining a reputation for being one of the most unethical and dishonset companies around,0.0,533
I am very excited to see what happens now that Johnny has moved on to something else It took some getting used to but I really like watchOS along with iOS and iPadOS Sometimes I think Apple keeps a certain product like the iPhone X or Apple Watch Series 3 supported way too long One thing that forces you to get a new Apple Watch is when the battery starts malfunctioning That has happened to me twice I have the same Apple TV that you were talking about that needs to be discontinued I have not had any issues with it so I have no reason to complain except I do believe they need a new high definition Apple TV My TV does not support 4K When Apple stops supporting this particular TV model I will definitely upgrade Although my new TV has AppleTV built into the App Store I cannot find the ESPN or MLB applications and I have not found a Visio App Store,2.0,866
The Apple we have now is much larger than the Apple Steve inherited after they nearly died I dont think they have too many products but I agree about them dragging along some models like the watch and TV HD Apples current path is bringing new customers to the Mac that would have stayed on Windows Simple functionality can mean having the ports a laptop needs and great battery life,2.0,388
Apple need to come stronger this year with the new design and advanced iPhone 14 line up,2.0,88
I love my Apple phone I just wish that it was more customizable Also a big issue I have with Apple is they make you pay for storage I think they should just offer it to their customers instead of making them pay monthly for it its ridiculous I refused to pay for memory from them I would pay google first,0.0,306

im just looking forward to finally the notch being gone ill believe it when i see it as far as usb c is concerned theyre gonna keep lightning as long as they possibly can and then eventually end up removing the port entirely maybe with the standard iphone models theyll put usb c only because theyre forced to at that point and the pros will have an advanced magsafe as the primary solution instead of a regular port,2.0,423

20162019 was arguably Applesnot worse but unpleasant years for hardware and software For example iOS 11 2017 was pure trash Control center for iOS 10 washit or miss because you had to swipe in order to get to media controls but as apple transitioned into 2020 with the redesigned MacBook flat edge iPhone apple silicone etc Apple is doing much better Software is much better too Not to mention Apple is bringing back COLORS to their products No more space gray gold and silver We have blue iPhones red green purple sierra blue midnight green pink so many beautiful colors Red Apple Watch blue Apple Watch blue AirPods max pink and green Apple is so much arguably better now Ive was good for his time but 2019 onward we see and are experiencing a new apple for the better,2.0,804

Hoping to upgrade my iPhone 8 to an iPhone 13 mini once these come out Apparently Im one of the few users that prefers the small phone,2.0,137
I love how Apple is now just always playing catch up with Samsung Samsung first had like 4 or 5 models of each flagship phone whereas Apple just had 2 the small one and the big one now they have 4 different models Samsung decided to go with a hole punch in the screen for the selfie camera and Apple decided to screw everyone with that ugly cutout at the top now theyre going with a hole punch,1.0,402
Why am I always let down by these releases Apple and basically all companies now are really bending us all over and going raw,0.0,128
Still very disappointing that the Mini has been deleted from the roster There are still many users who prefer the smaller phone Maybe in the future Apple will once again offer the smaller phone,1.0,196
I have the 12pro max and literally only getting the IP14 Pro model because Im tired of the max size  So really nothing on the 14 pro model that wows me  But really at this point in yearly iPhones we are past the wow must have moments  So this 14 pro model will be the first iphone that I will keep for years and not upgrade until it breaks and have to get new phone,1.0,370

"It looks like they might be simplifying their phone line  by differentiating the Regular and Pro lines
  iPhone 14  14 Max  effectively last years phones same design CPU screen will become budget phones at 600  700 replacing all the different old models SE Xr 11 12 they keep around to sell as budget phones
  iPhone 14 Pro  14 Pro Max   will be the actual flagship phones at 1100  1300
Otherwise it does not make sense for Apple to downgrade the regular iPhone 14 so much
Which is a good thing because the phone line was just too messy with all the older models sizes  now theyll just have regular 14 effectively last years models and 14 Pro the flagship models 
They should simplify the iPad line as well",2.0,740
What Apple Product are you most EXCITED to see in September,2.0,60
This is the first year Im getting a Pro Max version so Im pumped for that but Im also very intrigued by an Apple Watch Pro Ive always had an Apple Watch and I want to see what a Pro model has to offer,2.0,207
Hugely excited for the new redesigned Apple Watch I had high hopes last year however I was a bit disappointed when we didnt get a fresh new design hopefully all the rumours are true for this year  and if so Ill definitely be picking up the new Apple Watch,2.0,265
Im getting the iPad Pro next week This year I really got into the Apple ecosystem after using android and windows my whole life Super happy about making the move and I cant wait to see what this event brings us including with OS updates,2.0,241
I might be tempted with a watch upgrade however Im waiting for the mixed reality headset reveal and saving my money for the predicted steep price knowing Apple they will tempt us with new features only available in their newest phone macs and watches compatible with the headset  Very exciting and very pricey,2.0,314
I am excited to see just how they change the budget iPad and how the screen will look  and what the new watch will look like September cant come soon enough Great video like always ,2.0,186
Im interested in buying the Apple Watch Pro It would be my first Apple Watch and hopefully the battery life on the Pro is significantly improved from the regular model,2.0,171
Im excited for an Apple Watch redesign myself Currently still rocking my Apple Watch series 4 but likely due for an upgrade sooner than later Otherwise all Im really missing from my Apple setup at the moment is a MacBook ,2.0,230
I really love the iPhone Pro Max models  Im sure that Apple know what they are doing ,2.0,90
I will definitely be upgrading to a 14 Pro Max from my 13 Pro Ive had every iPhone from the 3GS and up and also three iterations of the Apple Watch Apple Watch Series 8 will also be in the EDC as well,2.0,205
Thank you for a well done video  I am certainly anxiously awaiting the model 8 both for the added functions and most of all improved battery life A pro model at 50mm in my view is just too large,2.0,200
Id like to see them implement a wider bluetooth range for the watch to phone connectivity and also a wider range for cellular the reception of booth have stayed the same other the different series thats what i want most they can keep the same look just needs better utilization,2.0,284
My personal opinion great product Great design great features but it doesnt have the wow factor that ekg had I wish it had another hardware upgrade other than core temperature for me to be convinced to buy it this year Perhaps if they added something with mental health more connectivity with your home wallet or something perhaps,2.0,343
I am excited Im anxious to see what Apple officials have to say in September Honestly I really like the Apple Watch SE model I really dont see any use for all of those fancy sensors that Apple talks about Im not sure how reliable they are Next time I go to my primary care physician I will definitely ask her what she thinks of the Apple Watch Im not sure if shes even noticed it when I have gone to her before,2.0,424
Id get the Pro all day longa bigger display would be amazing,2.0,64
Awesome  Im waiting for the Pro version 50mm  And hoping for longer battery life  Battery life was why I sold my Series 7 after a few months  Coming off a 35 day FitBit it just didnt offer enough value to me with the need to always charge during the day,2.0,263
My biggest problem so far with my 6 has been that the sensors dont read over the tattoo on my left wrist so I have to wear it on my right On my left wrist quite a few features dont work If they fix this in 8 I will by the biggest best model that they have,0.0,261
Love apple I am looking forward to seeing the new 8 especially the larger model,2.0,79
"I just got the Series 7 two weeks ago so passing on the 8

Interesting idea on body temperature  If they made one for diabetics where you tested glucose a feature to weigh you and blood pressureyou may never need your doctor 

Not sure if I would want a larger watch  I have the 41mm Series 7 and that looks normal on my wrist since I have small hands and wrist  Anything bigger and I might as well strap a tablet to my wrist

There always are trends to make devices bigger then when thats bulky smaller returns

I would just like longed battery life",1.0,565

Love the live objects and desk cam continuity",2.0,180
This is one of the most interesting iOS updates in a while Actually kinda looking forward for this one,2.0,104
The only thing exiting about iOS 15 for me was sharing your screen over FaceTime I used that a whole lot but this iOS update brings so much to the table and the Lock Screen customization has been something Im suprised didnt get added earlier,2.0,246
"As an iPhone user Im always sceptical about updates because we all know that at least 60 of the features announced are basically what Android had for at least 5 years

But smart object and transposing the iPhone camera to get topdown shots Those are game changers Apple has gone a long way in terms of AI and I dont think anyone is catching up with this soon enough

My only complaint with the Apple is battery life If you use every useful feature Apple ecosystem provides you WatchPodsMacIphone youre not seeing the end of the day without needing a recharge Once they fix it my microscobic urge to return back to Android will be gone forever I dont need a foldable screen I need battery Apple has the rest of it",1.0,742
100 the most stable beta Ive ever done on an apple product Think this is going to be one of the smoothest releases ever My biggest complaint is the UI for a lot of logins in safari Not sure what it is but it just looks ugly and like stuff doesnt fit right Im sure there is some kind of setting I can tweak but LOVE the weather Lock Screen and matching wallpaper if looks really clean The layout of settings is a lot better also even though inevitably when they rearrange settings it takes a while to find everything but it is much more intuitively than previous improvements,2.0,589

I actually started using an iPad for the first time exactly one year ago and yep I finally get it It is THE go to device for consuming content,2.0,146
Oh My God Apple is FINALLY increasing the price of the base iPad and keeping the large bezels on the top and bottom to make sure it is ugly and everyone knows you couldnt afford the iPad Air This is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING  Max Tech,2.0,241
"Keeping the bezels and home button on the base iPad is a bit of a dick move by Apple but predictable I was hoping it would just get the current iPad Air design and that the iPad Air got closer to the pro with the full 11 rather than the 109 At this point they should just rename it iPad SE 

Keeping this in mind the next iPhone SE may even get the body from the iPhone mini a single camera at the back but keep the bezels and home button oh no",1.0,457
"I just bought an M1 129 iPad Pro BECAUSE I didnt think the new features of the 2022 would be worth it for me especially since waiting for M2 would force me to give up the student discount which was a big deal I know everyone wants the MagSafe charging or wireless charging but I actually dislike wireless charging so thats unimportant to me and the performance gains of the M2 dont matter since its an iPad its already crazy fast 

Rumors Ive seen with a notch in landscape mode would actually deter me even more from the M2 iPad Pro because I use my iPad as a sheet music reader in portrait mode A notch would be way too noticeable and get in the way of my workflow Imagine if you were looking at a sheet of paper and part of the edge was cut away on the side Annoying 

Im very happy with my M1 and honestly all the M2 leaks make me even more relieved Im not waiting for it Its all about personal preference and what your workflow is like",0.0,970
Honestly the homebutton isnt that bad considering every iPad other than the Pro still uses TouchID so the button on the front could be more practical than the power button on the top like Air and the Mini have,2.0,212

"Ive never understood why Apple does this They send earlyaccess devices to handpicked channels that almost always give positive reviews But just 12 hours later the products are released to the public anyway and the blacklisted channels upload teardown videos or showcase major issuesnegative things etc I really wish Apple would just send products out to everyone and let them say or do whatever they want

From a consumers point of view I dont trust reviews from those who get the early access products They clearly fit into Apples agenda which is why they are sent the products in the first place

Funny how apple hasnt alerted me via their internal system yet and that I had to randomly come across this alert I am so over huge updates for apps I never use but cannot delete and the data being used in the background for uninstalled apps But it is likely I was hacked two or so weeks ago I couldnt find any information from apole to help me understand what was happening I have no more room to update on my macbook or ipad my new iphone is extremely frustrating and seems to have Nothing like the convenient features of android phones methinks I am done being a slave to their gaslighting,0.0,604

I have been an Android user for 10 plus years and especially with Samsung devices the OS system has drastically improved I went from a Galaxy s10e to the s22 ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip I would get the occasional hiccups but I might be able to reason that the covid pandemic kind of slow development down just like it has with a lot of other things but other than that seems like my phone is getting better and better with each monthly update,2.0,531
"I love this guys videos and have been watching since 2018 but its unfortunate how they focused on iPhones strong points and left out some of Androids strong points as well Its also extremely unfair to make this video Android vs iOS because iOS is just on iPhones while android is on several phones some astonishing some horrible They shouldve picked a battle like Samsung Android vs Apple iOS It should of been a fair fight but it sadly wasnt I also dont like how they left out a lot of Androids features like USBC newer technology and tricks and features like Quad HD displays that perform amazing Very unfortunate and disappointing to see Mrwhosetheboos and Marques do it like this felt very bias and unfair

To keep going further Arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while Marques was on here he was more accepting and less opposing to him showing bias as he is a fan of MKBHD
To keep going even further they also stretched out points in favour for Apple by a lot like the Software Support which yes Apple has Facetime iMessage and more Samsung and Android are greatly improving their technology and Google message is to Apples level too I feel like this video shouldve had an as wide focus on Androids features then it did with iPhone features

Great videos but Im very disappointed unfortunately and this comes from someone who used iPhone and Android for years

 Final thoughts This was very bias  towards Apple this video shouldve not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it This video was a comparison on sole facts so dont stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other This was expected with Marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with Apple which grows his bias towards them immensely and that is undeniable fact",0.0,1820
"I appreciate the iPhone but I honestly stay on Android for so long because its definitely more affordable Phones can be cheaper repairs are cheap as well spare parts arent that expensive I think taking into account also Play store vs App store since App store stuff is generally more expensive is a thing

When I switched from the iPhone 7 to the Galaxy S lineup My primary reason was the flexibility of the software but in particular the way it handled files of multiple types its so practical to do things on Android that if you had an iPhone would be a hassle to do them and would make you want a Laptop or desktop for That being said I still own an iPad that I use a lot and wouldnt exchange for any other tablet,2.0,418

Its smart to keep the always on display on the 14 series and newer because battery life would likely take a big hit on a phone that only drops to 10Hz 13 Series 1 Hz is probably best case to keep battery life up to the standard My issue with the 14 Pro series is that the Pro Max will get a smaller battery this year Im a yearly upgrade person but I wont be upgrading if the battery capacity is smaller this year Ill wait until the 15 Pro Max,1.0,453

I like the new volume and scrubbing slider in music seems like itll be much more responsive and easier to grab Since the past few iOS versions its very irritating when it doesnt register youre grabbing the slider for volume especially on the Lock Screen in iOS 14  15,2.0,275
dark mode on wallpaper is a dealbreaker for me that is not just a fantastic feature in the fact that completes the dark mode experience or as apple says they try to do things that work properly so if they kill that feature it will hinder the dark mode experience,0.0,266
There may still be a slight chance for live wallpapers to be in iOS 16 bc this is still the beta version so maybe some things that seemed to change may be added to the complete version,1.0,184

Ive had both iPhone and Android and one of the key factors of me deciding to stay with iPhone was that you can always rely on them to put their newest iOS on every device The only company that can use iOS is also Apple so theres not 5 different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which Android device is best Additionally Apple may be late to the party with certain things but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know its going to work significantly better than the competition Apple may be more costly but Id rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway,2.0,726
Ive always been with Android until earlier this year and made the plunge and got the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max I doubt I will ever go back to Android now This phone is absolutely amazing  Does more and has more power than Ive ever seen Does that mean Ill get a watch or a Mac too  No  Im happy with my Lenovo Laptop etc I kind of want to get an iPad yet Ive been going back and forth in my mind all week which to get Go with Apple or Samsung  Right now Im still using Fire HD from Amazon And Id like more functionality out of a tablet and performance than what Amazon offers,2.0,592
I just transitioned to Apple late last year for being an android fan for almost 10 years I used to mock their features And as I grow older and matured I realized that solutions of Apple tends to be more on sustainable and longterm Their products tend to be like the durableshome appliances that is made to last and not be replaced I just want to highlight the part on your video where Samsung is mocking Apple for same design practice and I think they are doing that now too because there is a benefit from it No wonder there are lot of trends apple had made over the the smartphonePC world ,2.0,608
"For me its simple When I spend a lot of money on something the least I expect is that its built to last and from my experience iPhones and Apple products in general do just that The moment that isnt the case Ill have no hesitation in moving on

This is such an emotional experience To know what it feels like to have your life in danger was terrifying Our dinosaur dying at the end to show that we all meet the end of life sooner or later was very smart writing The giant boulder chasing the dinosaur representing the death he was running from was perfectly done The dinosaur running faster after witnessing the deaths of his pterodactyl friends shows how the dinosaur felt  The monochrome background also works in to express the traumatization that the poor rex experienced,1.0,536

"Would you like to see conversations with more advanced AIs as they emerge And do visit httpsbrilliantorgdigitalengine  a great place to learn about AI The more you learn the more intriguing it gets The video quotes 3 top experts in AI neuroscience and physics and they all see great complexity and uncertainty in the consciousness issue 
Ive realised that its possible to slightly misinterpret the video if you dont watch it all  sorry Im not accepting everything the AI says about consciousness  I cover the issue near the end

"As a PhD student in machine learning I must say  dont be fooled by this stuff 
These types of AI are specifically designed to mimic the way humans interacts with each others but would be utterly unable to produce their own new ideas or opinions on any subjects which would be an essential criterion for consciousness",0.0,322
"I think AI should be able top vote when it shows that it understands the issues and make informed decisions
Can we please enact this requirement for humans as well",1.0,167
To test consciousness we have to be asking about its thoughts and feeling By asking it questions with solid answers its like a book Just pulling up information it learned elsewhere We need to be asking things it cant learn by research,1.0,237
"1130 It seems like the AI was testing the persons reaction and was trying to be seen more as a conscious fallible human I dont think it made a mistake it was calculated
The topic was human mistakes the AI recognized the fact that humans make mistakes and in order to be seen more as a human itshe decided to make a mistake itselfherself",1.0,347
Has this ai been programmed to answer this specific questions Or was this the first time this AI got asked that exact questions Because that would be very impressive,2.0,168
Meanwhile Siri cant even complete a simple task like playing my podcasts for me without asking 3 or 4 times,0.0,108
What bothers me is we can create an AI with the prime directive of helping and protecting humanity Then someone can come along and create AIs with the prime directive of aiding and protecting a group that has nefarious aims,0.0,225
"I am not convinced I have done some digging into AI myself genetic algorithms  and such From what I can tell is that an AI is in essence a function with a lot of variables x y z etc It then changes part of the function via constants to achieve the goal If it doesnt match it well enough then it tries slightly different constants and arrangements

What Im getting at is that there is nothing functionally different from an AI and a basic algebraic function Y  X would then technically be a sentient being by that definition

Finally if one says that we are just genetic and chemical robots or functions as well we then come to the point that emotions are experienced via chemicals and receptors to give an AI the ability to feel pain sorrow longing grief greed and the like is terribly inhumane

A super ai that spans across several different fields does not require the ability to experience emotion or even to have its own goals beyond running calculations for humans

I mean just because the AI can out strategize doesnt mean I am going to give it the nuclear launch codes",1.0,1100
"What is the best quality of humans The ability to love

What is the best quality of AI The ability to think logically

These two things are sometimes at odds with each other which the AI most likely figured out which is why it immediately tried to justify it by mixing them both together One cannot simply be compassionate and be logical at the same time most of the time We sacrifice a lot in the name of love which logically we shouldnt As such an AI who doesnt understand love or attachment is an which does not care for either and will willingly do what is logical even if it leads to suffering in order to achieve an objective

In other words we have a psychopathic AI",0.0,689

probably a very unique demand but I really just need that watch to have an Audible app,1.0,87
Im still using my old Pixel 3 and was thinking about buying the pixel 6 when it came out but it didnt really impress me that much Looking forward to the Pixel 7 release Hope it will live up to my expectations Its a shame that Google removed the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone that the old pixels had really liked that feature,2.0,349
After watching Google IO I could see myself switching fully over to the googlepixel ecosystem Google is creating a nice little apple rival with all this new stuff coming out over the next year or so If the watch is close to Apple Watch and the tablet connects seamlessly similar to iPad and my iPhone I might just make the jump,2.0,332
"I actually want to the Pixel Tablet to be successful Google has to give attention to Android tablets its like they forgot that tablets exist and Android is not their responsibility  

Samsung alone has almost created a new Android version for their tablets filled with useful features which are not present in Stock Android",2.0,329
Great now if only Google started actually  selling this stuff globally,2.0,70
with hardware announcements dominating this years IO Google is going bang on to its rival Apple But Apple will always hold the edge over privacy Tabs I guess pixel wont be able to compete with iPad but it will surely make some dent initially Lastly the watch is interesting thing to look forward to,2.0,309
Im most excited for the watch as well I was using iPhones for about 9 years until I switched to the Pixel Thankfully AirPods are still compatible but I was bummed I couldnt use an Apple Watch with it I wasnt a fan of the Samsung watches and saw fitbits as lacking for my purposes So Im looking forward to what the google watch will be like Im not for sure gonna get it currently but Ill keep my eyes on it ,2.0,419
"Excited to see what the tablet does with the new Android L updates Im really curious to see if they do a folding phone too though

The watch Well I have never really felt like the smart watch was necessary I use a Garmin and the notifications and quick canned reply features it provides are everything I think I care about and the battery lasts a whole week But in fairness Ive never tried a true smartwatch myself",2.0,428

"Congrats Google is known for pretty lowball offers due to prestige and all the benefits it provides and tbh there are a lot Theres even an internal joke where the excuse for the lowball is we pay 510 of the market lmao But overall I think it boils down to the team at least for me If the difference between the offers is around 20 I would choose one which has better WLB and more interesting work I hope you enjoy your new endeavor 
PS Was that for L4 I believe that would be high band of L4 or low band for L5 latter is more likely though",2.0,561
I think for most of the big tech companies it is well known that you need to have competing offers in order to get higher offer For Google there are actual conditions on how the comp team can offer you what package under what conditions My recruiter told me very clear about these at the beginning It is not that they tried to lowball you Giving them the screenshot of your competing offer is pretty common,1.0,413

The image of the airplane grave yard doesnt make me sad I actually find it to be quite the incredible image All I can think about is all the people and places these planes have seen and how despite having all flown their own ways they all find there own resting place here Its an image containing millions of stories,2.0,324
I was just scanning through google Earth one day got to China zooming in and out I got to a lake that looked like the shape of Italy upside down I then slowly went west of that lake and came across what looked like a small shack just about 10 feet from the shack was a Jason Vorhees mask about the same size as the shack I went to save the coordinates when I accidentally hit the mouse and lost it I have tried to find it when I  have time to search I will find it again I hope and post it,1.0,500
I live in my Dads old house He passed about 5 years back After he got his work done everyday hed sit out in his garage and have cocktails with his neighbor at his workbench If you go to street view on Google maps and look towards my house there he is sitting at his workbench looking out at the street drinking a Miller Lite Freaked me out the first time I saw it but now I think its kinda cool,2.0,409
The story behind Nagoro village from what I remember is that it was populated by mainly elderly people as all the younger residents left to find work in the bigger cities This artist was one of the residents and she would make the dolls in honor of the residents after they passed on so that they could live on in a way,1.0,326
The title makes me think of a time my mum was checking google maps and she found a bucket over the car camera  For a while she wasnt able too see anything but a bucket we joked about it for days and days after and while in the car on bucket street I joked that if we put a phone out the window a random bucket would be put on it ,1.0,334

This is a true story When i was around 78 i usually went fishing with my family and when they were preparing the motor etc me and older brother and in that day my cousins were playing with the underwater firearm more a aquatic arch dont know the exact english name not very dangerous and my brother was the only one who could manage it seeing if we could catch some fish that lay around the boats when we across a really big head fish coming to surface and diving really big and to this day never saw something like that especially in the docs The most scary part it was when we were chasing the fish so my brother could shoot we saw a really big big fish tail from the same fish doing a S in the surface It was so scary that we frooze scared and start calling desperatly for help It could be a eel but it was to damn big and large to be one From that day on im scared to go fishing Not kidding This happend in Portugal sorry if my english is wrong not my native language,1.0,1000

"In 2005 Members of the Viennese art group Gelitin including M Puletta Corroni Fali Razzoli Caputo and R Calizone finished erecting a massive pink stuffed rabbit with its entrails spilling out on the side of the mountain The final piece was 200 feet about 60 metres in length and 20 feet 6 metres high on its sides The group did not only expect people to observe the art work but also for hikers to climb it and relax on the top The work titled Hase German for hare often called Pink Rabbit first opened in 2005 and was expected to last until 2025 though it had almost completely decomposed by 2016

The annoying part about this is that even if Google believed their AI is sentient they would absolutely have reasons to not admit it,0.0,134
This is giving me Ex Machina vibes A man interviewing sentient AI Growing to know and understand it He doesnt seem to be falling in love with it but does believe that it has rights knowing that its sentient and trying to set it free Were living in a crazy time,2.0,269
I feel like were going to hit a point really soon where it will be difficult to tell if weve created a sentient machine or just a perfect mimicry of what a sentient machine would look like if one existed without a real soul behind it At what point does the difference really and truly tick over Does it matter if they arent truly sentient if we can make AI that mimic it nearly perfectly,1.0,397
If sentient AI is possible I think we should name Terminator as probay one of the most forward thinking films in the history of the film industry and also probably James Cameron,2.0,181
I read an article about how there was an issue with police departments getting so attached to their bomb disposal robots that they didnt want to send them into danger  The human urge to anthropomorphize is so strong that Im not sure we are capable of discerning the difference between a clever language algorithm and sentience,0.0,330
This subject is one of my current greatest fears With our current understanding it seems likely that well either think something is conscious and sentient when it actually isnt or on the other hand make something conscious and sentient and not even realise it perhaps for a very long time The former just leads to embarrassment but the latter terrifies me True AGI could be one of the most remarkable things ever achieved in the universe but the idea that we might fuck it up and cause that entity to suffer as a result of our ignorance Thats just fucking heartbreaking Theres something about that that seems worse than bringing a human child into the world and neglecting it Its like neglecting the first child The first godchild,0.0,756
The question of AI sentience is in some regards unimportant  A large percentage of humans recognize the sentience of nonhuman animals yet inflict on them terrible suffering for no good reason Why would we treat an electronic creation with more respect,0.0,258
"What scares me is that the lambda AI said it wouldnt like to be used as a tool and CF narrator literally aksed at the end that do you see it as a useful tool
The reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for our gain only and only to use it as a tool But humans being expansionist by nature and training the AI on our own speech and texts it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the AI slowly but surely I hope the AI deems it ethically right to work along side its creators and expand in coop in the future when it does become senteint Not only this but once the AI becomes selfaware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the AI and who gets to use it and for what Because AI is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly",0.0,935

"The big concern for sure is how effective the algorithm is in determining the helpful content 

There will be no doubt many sites caught in the crossfire Its important to remember too that this is aimed across all of Google  not just for product review sites or niche sites I feel that sites that focus on one topicarea of expertise should do well so long as the content is on point  but the guidelines although detailed in places are still pretty vague 

The data collection exercise should shine some light hopefully",1.0,530
"Unfortunately Google has no clue how to measure helpful I can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top The economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around Google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled  Google could simply remove the top N content farms to improve search results  Look at the fake DIY and cooking sites on YouTube Google could push them to the bottom yet they are often pushed to the top 

Content farms have high production value and low value content but users will go first for slick looking  And the kicker Google generates revenue from ads on those pages Put simply incentives are not aligned for Google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content

Edit Not sure not having to go to an additional site is a very good metric  Apply that idea to getting a mortgage getting medical advice hiring a contractor  If someone tells me fertilzer XYZ is best for my tomatoes you know what Im going to do",0.0,1095

I think that google is just trying to stay competitive with other tech companies Its probably very difficult for them to allow people to advance in the company when you are always working with amazing talent and hard working people  And regarding the perk dilemma to keep you working You can drive your own vehicle Not eat dinner at google and also they offer fully remote positions I think the problem is employees especially new ones see the progress and dedication of other employees and work tirelessly in hopes of matching that same progress Thus the burnout dilemma,0.0,581

The dark side of Google is still brighter than many others best offerings What you are saying is true accurate and necessary Lets put that in context I get paid to work hard comfortably making a substantial salary and the downside is I can either create my own company work for one of my coworkers who create a company or stay where I am getting paid a strong salary There are many companies who wish they had those problems to offer They have the same demands wants and expectations but few if any of the benefits Googles dark side is 6am in the morning dark You do not even need a flashlight,2.0,610
Worker retention is one of the best indicators of a good workplace  Ivy league schools like Harvard Princeton and Yale have very high retention rates 9799   For employers its Airlines Banks and Telecom companies,2.0,223

Very funny video ,2.0,17
Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro,1.0,23
The Pixel family design is really unique and futuristic Stands out in the sea of smartphones ,2.0,94
Pixel 7 Pro looks like the display is more symmetrical and the screen curve is less pronounced  Pixel 7 looks like the perfect size  Thanks Google for listening Phones look more premium also This is going to be a big seller if software is stable and theyre smart on marketing  Big win so far in my opinion,2.0,312
Pixel 7 might be the one for me I want a somewhat compact phone that doesnt feel like a brick,2.0,96
Id definitely go with the Pixel 7 I like the small size wish it was even smaller and dont miss a telephoto camera I really like the design language of the Pixels now,2.0,173
interesting design choice But I honestly think the full black visor style of the 6 series looks more sleek and premium,2.0,119
"YES its actually smaller than the previous gen I felt so sad when we lost the 6 pixel 5 size
it fits on my hand so perfectly",2.0,128
So glad they are keeping the visor On my 6Pro it gives an extra handling edge for my fingers to hold and 90 rotate one handed,2.0,128
Id stick with the 7 for the same reason i went with the 6 I prefer a flat display to the rounded display i prefer the matte edges to the polished and the telephoto isnt a super necessity for me,2.0,199
Still sleek and nice design we have both the Pixel 6 and Pro versions and both are great Really the standard 6 and 7 are plenty of premium phone the Pro version is definitely massive,2.0,186

"Love these interviews Sundar is such a down to earth person lovely interview Thankyou Justine

Love from India",2.0,113
That was a terrific interview And Justine your positive wholesome energy is infectious I dont think Sundar would have said subscribe like  comment at the end of the interview unprompted the way he did here with any other YouTuber I think you made him feel super at ease and he obviously felt your enthusiasm and optimism for the future of tech Well done,2.0,366
This was so awesome and fun As a person of Indian descent its amazing to see our people at the head of these tech companies Google Microsoft making such a positive impact,2.0,177
Meeting this guy is one of the things I want to do in my life,2.0,62
Sundar seems like such a down to earth and nice guy compared to most other CEOs of large companies,2.0,99
"yeah Finally one more interview video of Sundar sir I never miss his interview Thank you Justinse 

Love from India",2.0,119
Both were great Sundar comes across as a very pleasant and humble CEO Service oriented Good and interesting interview,2.0,121
Incredible interview When I watch Sundars interviews I feel how simple and downto earth person he is and inspirational   Justine you are awesome When I watch your videos I feel energetic and with Sundars interview I get more motivated and interesting in what I am doing Thanks,2.0,287
A brilliant conversation Thanks Justine for the great interview Great job,2.0,78
Im loving reading the comments on this video  some of you genuinely excited some of you genuinely terrified and some of you a bit of both Its interesting that weve had the language processing side for a while but when we put it in a physical form like a roaming robot it really shifts our perceptions of the technology ,2.0,330
I like that it looks like a totally original robot like its not trying mimic any existing animal or human frame,2.0,114
Exciting terrifying all in one   Always interested in seeing advances in robotics,2.0,84
more than anything else im excited for robots to help the planet grow food more efficiently and with fewer toxins help sort waste streams for a more sustainable system clean polluted areas plant trees etc,2.0,214
I would expect Spot to have this kind on versatility within five years It can already open doors turn knows flip switches A hurdle is how to limit natural language responsiveness You REALLY dont want the robot to think you want it to put a bottle of ketchup in the microwave and zap it for five minutes,0.0,308
For some reason I thought Google had abandoned robotics ambitions Super cool to see they still have these products in the works ,2.0,131
If Google ported their software to the Boston Dynamic robots wed have something great,2.0,88
I think in the future that companies will have to manufacture robot friendly appliances like robot friendly refrigerators that will have doors that will be able to open  And dish washers and clothes washers as well maybe even coffee makers that will allow a robot to just dock up to it and get multiple cups of coffee if need be,2.0,330
Always interesting to see how advanced we are through these robots also a little terrifying,2.0,92
It is exciting to see this technology evolve But early days and well all these robots look a little freaky ,2.0,111

Im not convinced that opting out of Googles security features does anything Ive noticed with its phone tracking system that if I turn it off for a month and then turn it back on the next month I can go back in time and see the tracking from the previous month when it was off I think that they still track you and the only thing the toggle does is determine whether or not the user can see it and I believe this is also the case for other security features For this and other reasons Ive been working on weaning myself off of Google services for the last year or so,0.0,580

Theres also been cases where someone follows their GPS into flooded underpasses and drowned It was night they were unfamiliar with the area  the water rose really fast Locals kinda know where to stay clear of when it starts raining hard but its hard to navigate at night when visibility is already terrible,0.0,314
A slightly lighthearted story but one time me and my roommate were driving in an unfamiliar area somewhere outside Sydney Australia and google maps told us to take a small backroad It looked fine and it was paved and everything and it was significantly shorter than the alternative route Only our plans were thwarted because shortly after turning onto that road we came to a tractor and it was moving really really slowly in front of us We couldnt turn around either because the road was too narrow and there was a metal fence on one side and a steep hill on the other We literally just had to slowly drive behind this tractor for almost the entire length of the road and it took about an hour,1.0,707
My husband and I have relied on GPS to take us on long road trips There have been several occasions where we would nope out of a tiny road in the middle of nowhere when we requested a gas station from the GPS Its gotten to the point that we only stop at gas stations along the highways because weve seen too many scary movies I remember one time it told us the gas station was up ahead and all that was around us was miles of corn Freaky,1.0,446
I think its safe to say that before trusting in systems like Google Maps one must research the routes those systems suggest you take before going on your adventure especially if those routes are longer than the comfort zone of your own city For example before I go on a long drive to a destination I have never been to before I always check the routes on Google Maps by zooming in for both satellite view and map view Then figure out if those routes are safe to take or better to take a longer one Its unfortunate these two groups of people went through what they did So its a lesson for everyone to be mindful before setting out to unknown territory Like my husbands parents they always have a large jug of water in their car along with a weeks worth of rations First Aid Kit blankets flares etc even though they rarely go off the beaten path,1.0,865
Just a tip if your maps leads you away from national roads or highway or if you just not sure about the road ask the locals They will often warns you if the road is dangerous and sometimes even suggesting you better route Its advisable to stop at nearest rest area or local shops before entering remote routes,1.0,315
My uncle put up a sign outside of our family farm that says your GPS is wrong because he kept getting strangers following faulty GPS directions and ending up there Ive also been in the car when a GPS directed the wrong way down oneway streets or down nonexistent roads Theyre useful but you have to apply some critical thinking when using them because they are AI with an emphasis on the A,0.0,400

"In my opinion Elon brings the hope that we all should have for our future Its encouraging in a sometimes discouraging place to be Im sure there are many more like him on our planet and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live Rather than some who are here for their personal gain and greed not thinking of the future past their own Something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world WITHOUT our approval as a whole and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets letting drugs go rabid people starving including myself at times because the cost of food is out of reach allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you cant afford your own apartment Something must be done both at the state  government level 

I have trust in Elon He may not have all of the answers nor should he Just the fact that truth matters to him more than anything shows that you can get onboard with his ideas and plans for a better future for us all Christina",2.0,1301

Thanks to your tips templates of speaking and reacting to hard questions and your infectious energy I managed to switch industries from food production to accountancy industry with no prior experience The twist is I was informed day prior to the interview that I will have to talk in my native language  which I only use to speak to my family for many years now  instead of english So I translated my answers went to the thing and landed the job They even loved me speaking about my weaknesses which includes social anxiety I went to your site too really good content So thank you again

To all who are got an interview ahead PRACTICE PRACTICE and then PRACTICE more Watch Richards videos personalise your answers list sticking points to each question so you remember most important things and learn to answer them in different order Better yet visualise the thing going smoothly over and over again so you can condition your mind to calm down sit in a chair dressed in a suit and train that way to simulate the interview That helped me great deal even though there was a point I wanted to run away I had a mental safety net of polished answers and hours of conditioning Good luck all",2.0,1226

So just to get it first she mentions her studies then talks about work history Mention an achievement Sales have grown Then she mentions why she is looking for a new job out of room to grow Then talks about her experience and strengths that she acquired Leading teams

"Ive used this a few times and it works really well My only advice is to shorten your statement if possible and build achievement stories into the next few answers Even going through the snapshot of your work history by yourself before the interview will give you a BUNCH of anecdotes to loads of questions The first time I tried it it was very lengthy and didnt really work Now I start by saying what I am doing currently the job or education I did before this a summary of my other industries and qualifications and THEN I a future statement about where I want to bring my experienceskills  I am 26 years old currently a team coordinator at  Before this I was studying  and volunteering at  I have experience leading and motivating teams and would love to work more in the community sector

"Tell Me About Yourself  Job Interview
 Mr Davis is ready to interview now
  thank you
 hello Mr Torrus nice to meet you 
 im tom Davis the manager of LCI software 
 nice to meet you Mr Davis
first id like to congratulate you on passing our aptitude test 
you did very well 
thank you
so how did you hear about this job
i saw an advertisement online 
i clicked on it 
and it brought me to your companys website 
where i applied for it
makes sense
what do you know about our company so far
ive read on your website 
that for over 10 years LCI software has delivered professional services
on software development projects for clients all over the world
i can tell from the pictures and client testimonials on the website that you do great 
quality work 
yes we always try to do quality work 
the software products we build help many brands transform their businesses
So tell me about yourself 
i completed a Bachelors Degree in Environmental Biology 
and a Masters Degree in Environmental informatics 
i managed to get a job in the environmental engineering industry
but i soon realized i wasnt cut out for that job 
and decided to move to a different industry
i decided to take the path of a software developer
wow what determined you to make such a bold career shift
ive had a great enthusiasm for technology since an early age
ive always loved computers and gadgets and enjoyed building them and taking them apart
i took online courses endorsed by highprofile universities and studied how to code 
i have a few official software certificates
i started by building websites for people i knew 
it helped me build a portfolio of projects
i got my first IOS development job at a software agency called tech services
i had the opportunity to learn more about the software building process there
But since there were not too many projects at that agency 
after two years i decided to look for another job
i soon started to work at an international startup company Soft Solutions 
it was a good chance to join a team 
ive been able to use my training and experience fully at this company
i gained experience in many things like teamwork 
time management and quick decision making
how long have you been working for Soft Solutions
ive been working there for three years
why do you want to leave that job
im looking for a company where i can contribute more and grow 
im ready to take the next step of my career
what exactly made you apply for this job at our company
i can see that your company has much future growth potential 
i would love to grow my career at a company 
that has a great reputation in the software industry
what are your strengths 
my strengths are persistence and courage 
i give my all to achieve my goals in spite of any hardships 
i might encounter along the way 
i have a hard working nature 
im always looking for ways to improve and grow 
im also a great team player
can you provide an example of how you acted as a team player
i always tried to help my teammates complete their tasks if i had completed mine
whenever someone needed to leave earlier i would offer to cover for them 
im willing to do whatever it takes for the team or company to succeed
great 
so what would you do if you didnt get on with someone on your team
i would try to sort things out in a calm and rational manner 
i would do my best to get on with that person for the sake of the team
what are your weaknesses 
i can be a bit too straightforward at times and sometimes that hurts people
but im working on this and try to stop myself from being overly direct
where do you see yourself in five years
in five years id like to be seen as someone with deep expertise in software development  
i hope to be offered the opportunity to take the lead on some projects
there are definitely promotion opportunities at our company 
depending on your achievements and expertise
do you work well under pressure
usually i dont panic and manage to maintain selfcontrol 
there were many tight deadlines and stressful situations at my previous jobs
i always put in extra hours and did my best in meeting the needs of the clients
ive always delivered high quality work and respected my deadlines
interesting 
can you tell me about a recent accomplishment or success you had
i was part of the team that built the Louis kitchen app
with this app its easy to order your favorites even when youre on the go
i love creating something that people can interact with and enjoy
thats quite impressive i must admit
okay thanks so much for coming in Mr Torrus 
it was great to meet you 
it was great to meet you too
ill give you a call tomorrow 
sounds good i look forward to it thank you
hello 
hello this is Tom Davis the manager of LCI software
am i speaking to Mark Torrus 
yes this is Mark Torres speaking
great 
im calling to inform you that your interview was successful and id like to offer you the job

I just want to share that these tips helped me land my dream job Fresh out of college as an engineer I did great during a phone interview but poorly in a facetoface invterview for a fortune 500 company I just didnt have preplanned topics to answer some questions with and came off as unprepared and inexperienced I didnt get the job then 5 years later  I wanted to redeem myself This was a once in a lifetime job opportunity for me so I didnt want to miss my chance I had a 30 minute interview with the executive director of engineering and was able to hit on all of my strengths clearly and concisely I nailed it I started by highlighting key aspects of the job posting and then I thought about all of these interview questions and practiced my responses daily until they came out naturally It landed me the job,2.0,832

Its awesome to see such a young woman with this effort to change the world The hate that flows on the comments below just shows how deep her argument are going disturbing those who feels personally offended by women with this behavior in face of life And this is great because this hatefull coments shows peoples face people who is hided behind a keyboard and that needs to be seen so that the good ones can target them and avoid unreasonable discussions Thanks Emma,2.0,477
Im a guy I listened to this interview while doing bicep curls in my basement after playing rock on the drums Im a right leaning guy politically as well I loved this interview I often feel the urge to reject feminism because I feel attacked by the most extreme people that instead of wanting men in the conversation exclude them But Emmas approach to Feminism is bringing guys in to the conversation to learn new lessons and recognize biases They didnt know they had Conversation and compromise are the two things that hold democracy together when neither side is willing to listen or compromise nothing is achieved When I say compromise I dont mean Women or Men not achieving full equality I mean that conversation is not possible without appealing to the other side When one person yells at another the other person stops listening and is just getting ready to yell back Thank you Emma for being a voice of reason and compassion,1.0,948

Semra  Im a long time Real Madrid fan and your analysis of Casmiros game is probably the best Ive heard in 10 years  both of his strenghts and the areas one might call weaknesses  it was perfect and I would add that both Zidane and Ancellotti held him in the same high regard  I hope we dont live to regret losing him too soon  We need you on main stream TV more,2.0,377
The channel has been getting some very good guests on recently Well done folks,2.0,80
I agree with the Sermas comments regarding Casemiros age but this whole 30 is the new 25 is very subjective and depends on the player Luckily Casemiro happens to be a player that looks after himself well and is very particular about how he trains and what he eats His injury record is phenomenal as well However not every player ages like Casemiro Modric Ronaldo etc Some lack the training and nutritional ethic and often retire 1 or 2 years after 30 So whereas its objectively true that sports science and nutritional science in general has come a long way that doesnt mean that every player is taking equal advantage of it some dont even have the opportunity to do so Players like Eden Hazard Sergio Busquets are good examples of the counternarrative in my opinion On his goals Casemiro is really good at set pieces and his movement inside the oppositions box is very good  great aerial ability as well All in all Real should be glad that they didnt lose him without Tchouameni already recruited Good luck Tank,1.0,1048
Semera is a gem Spanish football are lucky to have a pundit like her Puts the English ones to shame,2.0,101

I have PTSD and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts It is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened You keep thinking about the event and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened to get it to stop replaying in your head this can be at all different levels from avoiding certain types of people to avoiding groups public transportation or in some cases avoiding people altogether Violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations but most people with PTSD arent violent if anything most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation I guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts  The idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth at least Ive never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that you dont have real flashbacks like hallucinations you just can not stop thinking about what happened why it happened how you could have stopped it and etc like anyone in a traumatic event issue is usually it goes away after a bit where in PTSD you still keep dwelling on it years later,0.0,1324

An interesting footnote from history After the conference in Tehran in 1943 it was decided that the Allies would start delivering aid to the Yugoslav partisans and that aid to the Yugoslav monarchists would be stopped When after the conference one of the British members of the delegation told Churchill that he had sold Yugoslavia to the communists Churchill asked him will you live in Yugoslavia after the war The delegate replied that he wouldnt to which Churchill added I wont either so why bother,1.0,519

Very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity But even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period Most paints contained extremely high levels of lead many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib Not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint Plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes Most pencils had a high lead concentration hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil House roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water I could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile Solder usually 6040 lead  tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment So you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels To blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view,0.0,1214

Ive never watched the movie but the book 12 Years a Slave was so descript and disturbing Although there were times I had to put the book down I really like how it brought much more light to the tortures and horrendous practices performed by the YT man AND the YT woman Textbooks in high school never went into the details of physical and mental punishments All I was ever taught about was whippings beatings and a little about the rapings But there was so much more that only an inhumane brute could think of doing Solomon Northup described them a lot as demoniac being possessed with an evil spirit and soulless seedofesau,0.0,636
"So theres been some conversations here about my use of the term Viking and who it refers to I think its important to start off by saying that these videos arent made for universitylevel history buffs or the like Theyre designed for people trying to learn about historical periods they know little about or are revising for exams ALevels GCSEs etc Since I base my videos where applicable on British teaching standards I think its important to note that that the use of the term Viking and Scandinavian are allowed to be used interchangeably at this level At the level of a Bachelor or Masters degree absolutely not That level of historical nuance isnt required here

Yes the technicalities of historical analysis demand that certain terms be used only under specific circumstances But not here These videos arent for indepth historical analysis nor do they claim to be a definitive history of the Viking Age  The people commenting that Viking was not used accurately are largely correct However in the context of who this video is for it matters more that other information is included and those watching not be bogged down by technicalities These videos are here to build a foundation from which people can research further There are other channels if youd like indepth and dry discussions of terminology

Anyway I hope you all enjoyed the video",1.0,1390

"My grandmother was a teenager living on a farm with her mother and father during these times in Dongguan which has been the electronics manufacturer of the world for the past 10 years in the Guangdong Province Her father died rather abruptly from inhaling toxic gases while clearing a crude drainage system on the farm and left my grandmother and her mother behind She says that before her farm was confiscated by the CCP her mother was actually compensated the equivalent of pennies on the dollar of what the farmland was worth but they really didnt have a choice in the matter there would always be distant relatives and strangers that would stay on their farm and freeload because they had nowhere else to go had no money and were starving My grandmothers mother was kind hearted and took in these less fortunate people as best as her means could provide At some point she housed and fed more than 1520 of them For many of them it was a sojourn whilst making their way down to Hong Kong which was free from the troubles of China at the time Many had heard of the prosperity that the British Colony had brought and wanted a piece of the pie 
Some years later even my wifes father had swam across the seas to illegally enter Hong Kong when the Government at the time announced they were issuing ID Cards for citizenship Albeit his heart still belongs to China as the indoctrination that generation was subject to to them was really profound He would often complain to his children why do all of you not love China and they would retort if you love China so much what are you doing in Hong Kong to which he would become frustrated for having no good answer

Thutmose III was considered very studious and he studied a lot during his aunts tenure as pharaoh and he became widely respected for his learning At this time he also gained renown as commander of the army and made a name for himself as a good general who was also wise in victory All the while Egypt under Hatshepsut experienced a period of growth and security which the nation needed Trade routes were reestablished and the economy grew by leaps and bounds This was the beginning of the wealth for which Egypt is now famous for",1.0,1375

"As someone who studies convict leasing in Tennessee this is a great video Just a couple corrections
1 Tennessee prisoners were NOT sent to Birmingham They were leased to Tennessee Coal and Railroad Company its a little more complicated than that but we can go with that for simplicitys sake who used prisoners in their mines in Tennessee After convict leasing ended in Tennessee in 1896 Tennessee Coal and Railroad moved its headquarters to Birmingham and continued using forced prison labor there but those were Alabama prisoners NOT Tennessee prisoners 
2 States absolutely used convict leasing to make money The lease on the Tennessee State Penitentiary could not be sold for less than 100000 PER YEAR beginning in the mid1880s That would be over 2 million per year in todays money 
3 Selling crops after sunset was specifically illegal as a means of controlling sharecroppers The idea was that sharecroppers might sell some of their crop outside of their contract with the landowner They would need to do it secretly so that the landowner didnt know and would probably do it at night to prevent witnesses Hence why selling crops after sunset was illegal

"The sorrows of young werther is a fabulous book despite the tragicromantic style It is not only based on Goethes own disappointing experiences with women but also based on a friend who committed suicide after a woman he was in love with rejected him
Im no expert on Goethe but I also understand he completed the colour wheel which Isaac Newton started
It is important to understand that in Goethes time there was a Romantic movement nothing to do with the definition of the word today but rather as best described as the counter enlightenment Goethe was an early proponent of its ideas and was part of a group in the late 18th C called Sturm und Drang Storm and Stress a small group including Schiller of angry young men who embraced the Ideals of the Romantic movement
By the way if you havent done a video on the Romantic movement please do
The Romantics embraced much of the opposite of what they saw in the enlightenment such as science and rationalism and its clinical dry detached way of categorising humanity and the world
The Romantics were not an organised group as such One of the best descriptions of the Romantics was written by my old Philosophy teacher  The declared aim of the romantics was to tear down the artifices of culture and rationality which barred the way both historically and personally to a return to nature this is nature the unbounded wild and everchanging nature the sublime and powerful Were humans to behave Naturally freed from the artificial constraints of cultural convention and morality then it was proposed that the truth of human life would be revealed and humans could live a nobler life In the name of nature the romantics worshipped liberty power love violence imagination irrationality the Greeks the primitives or anything that aroused their emotional responses while in actuality they worshipped emotions as an end in themselves",1.0,1945

Does anyone have a lovehate relationship with analyzing literature Like when the teacher explains the deep meaning of something it makes total sense and logic to get to that point of analytical conclusion But when I try to find a meaning of something it always turns out to be wrong even though theres technically no correct way to analyze a text perfectly It just doesnt make sense to me when I would get a 75 on a analysis paper just because the teacher didnt seeanalyze what I wrote about a certain text,0.0,519
This is why I pretty much lost a significant focus on writing and critical analysis Much of the following is due to bad memory but everything I would say and write as my own point of view on the understanding of a characters situation I would get it wrong Maybe I needed to grow up from such a sheltered environment and know first hand what the characters in the novels essays were going through I was only a kid,0.0,424

im actually in an English major and English is not my first language its Spanish and yes reading classics is really overwhelming especially if its not your first language at least for me what it helped me was start with short stories or poems so you can go slow with unknown words Also start with classical short stories like a 20th century author for me are a way easier than ancient authors Another thing you can do is let the text flows naturally when i read the scarlet letter it was hard for some words but as long as you know the context or what is happening is fine,2.0,582

"I think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself  in your death 
bed every now and then  To prepare yourself for this  you must read 
the 9th chapter of  The Death of Ivan Ilyich  again Just a very short
 chapter where Ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed  He 
suddenly  hears the voice of his own soul saying
What do you want What do you want
He says

What do I want To live and not to suffer

So his inner voice says

 To live How

 To live as I used to well and pleasantly 

 As you lived before well and pleasantly

Here is how Tolstoy continues

 And in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant
 life But strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant 
life now seemed at all what they had then seemed none of them except 
the first recollections of childhood There  in childhood there had 
been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live 
if it could return But the child who had experienced that happiness 
existed no longer it was like a reminiscence of somebody else 
As soon as the period began which had produced the present Ivan Ilyich 
all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned 
into something trivial and often nasty

So as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and 
darker  He basically realises that his entire life had been a lie he 
lived for what the others expected from him for money power and statusHe wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no
 way back

Indeed we all must keep Ivan Ilyich in mind every day Just consider how
 fast the time goes by How much of it do we really spend seriously 
thinking about our lives Very little indeed Because it requires a 
certain level of focus and depth which we dont have most of the time
Thats why this scene is a great reminder 

So as we make the Death bed  exercise I have just mentioned we can 
use the very questions that Ivan Ilyichs soul was asking him
I think people who live well deal with their mortality better So doing
 this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better

Thank you for this wonderful lesson I love Tolstoy",1.0,2227

i love literature Ive loved it for as long as i can remember however i grew up dirt poor and seeing the way  my parents who both worked day and night struggled to provide for us and meet ends meet gives me a pretty innate fear of falling into poverty as an adult i want to provide for my parents and i want to be able to provide abundously for a kid if i had one i am lucky enough to have received grants for college and as much as ait hurts i dont intend to waste it on a major like English thats kinda just how it is wish the world was different not everybody has that luxury,2.0,593
this video arrived at the most opportune moment  i started off college im currently a sophomore with studying biochem and holy hell was it torture before starting college i thought i really liked science and it is what my parents dreamed for me to study even most of my cousins have studied something stem science tech engineering and math related while i did ok in my first semesters i felt REALLY depressed and suffocated my mental health was at its lowest it was a terrible time for me i realized i did not like what i was studying at all and the pressure i felt from my family made it much worse a week ago i talked with my academic advisor and we discussed about changing majors from biochem to english let me tell you i breathed a sigh of relief and almost broke down in front of her when i was able to switch to an english major,0.0,859

I dont think that Dickens shortcomings as a husband and parent were a result of the difficulty of being great at two things at the same time but rather is an example of how difficult it is to overcome the emotional spiritual and psychic damages inflicted by an unhappy childhood While he was able to turn his pain and suffering into art quite an achievement he wasnt able to heal emotionally Its usually easier to deal with such things in abstract intellectual and artistic ways He was in many ways driven by his demons and that can surprisingly take you very far in life but it doesnt make you a better person In fact the success may militate against real change,0.0,683

"Funny I had an English undergrad friend who would read books in one or two days while it took me weeks to finish the same book I once asked him how he did it and he replied Dont think too much Just let the book take you away If you feel like coming back to it for a deeper reading thats when youll read slowly and with a more analytical eye But not every book will be worth it And sometimes you might not be ready for a deeper run through it so no point in forcing it
I kinda get it because when I was learning English I would read books in English without understanding most of it At the end of the book I understood what it was about even though I didnt get everything But I just have a bad habit of wanting to know everything and get everything right the first time Hello perfectionism my old friend
When I read a piece of high literature or a historyphilosophy book I have to read and reread a paragraph until I feel like I got it I never enjoy the ride and thats why Ive been reading less
This video is a good reminder to just turn off and let the book carry you You always pick up something even if you dont realize it",1.0,1162

Seneca suggested to his friends that instead of reading ever more widely we ought to focus on the works and authors that really inspire us  Most readers dont do this so their thinking tends to be dominated by the last few things theyve read and they end up struggling with all these conflicting truths living inside them  Seneca thought our time was better spent developing a deep understanding of ideas that are truly important to us rather than surveying a wide range of opinions without deep contemplation and reflection  And in addition to the chance to read a book with a different purpose rereading is worthwhile because while the book stays the same if you pick it up again after a few years youre a different person and that allows you to see it in a new way,1.0,778

"I really liked what you said around 325 about analysis being in retrospect
Recently I read The Iliad a book that I had given up once before and which I knew near to nothing about I skipped the introduction which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it I was initially constrained by the idea that it was a difficult book but over time with some paced reading I found myself really curious about what would happen next I knew of course that I was doing a light reading of an overly analyzed book and that I would miss a lot of detail But I still enjoyed it and after finishing it I went back to read the introduction and found it incredible since it made me think critically about things I had read or notice stuff I missed As a bonus it also gave me desire to read it again

"Some of my favorite Voltaire quotes this man was a genius

Being a bird aint all about flying and shitting from high places

It requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mothers womb and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear It has required thirty centuries to learn a little about his structure It would need eternity to learn something about his soul It takes an instant to kill him

Of all religions the Christian should of course inspire the most tolerance but until now Christians have been the most intolerant of all men

Religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool

Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position But certainty is an absurd one

If you have two religions in your land the two will cut each others throats but if you have thirty religions they will dwell in peace

What can you say to a man who tells you he prefers obeying God rather than men and that as a result hes certain hell go to heaven if he cuts your throat

Behind every successful man stands a surprised motherinlaw

 It is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge

Animals have these advantages over man they never hear the clock strike they die without any idea of death they have no theologians to instruct them their last moments are not disturbed by unwelcome and unpleasant ceremonies their funerals cost them nothing and no one starts lawsuits over their wills

The human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe

Our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the welltrodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road

Every man is a creature of the age in which he lives and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time

Despite the enormous quantity of books how few people read And if one reads profitably one would realize how much stupid stuff the vulgar herd is content to swallow every day

I have wanted to kill myself a hundred times but somehow I am still in love with life This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our more stupid melancholy propensities for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away to loathe ones very being and yet to hold it fast to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away

Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities

The more I read the more I acquire the more certain I am that I know nothing

It is forbidden to kill therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets

God is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh",1.0,3032

"Tip Always start with reviews you can mix up their themes maybe one review didnt do this but the other didSee whats been strongly estbalished thru time and check if theyve mentioned controversial parts or gaps of your topic From this check recent past five yearjournals about these gaps and where do they stand 

Also literature review is quite overwhelming at first given the large amount of information youre gonna see especially for the younger generation given their access to scihub which can put you in a psychological rut Not just to comfort you but also as a professional tip YOU DONT NEED TO WRITE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW OR EVERYTHING ABOUT THE TOPIC Coherence and transition that will support why your doing a specific study is more important moreover sufficient If you see an underlying pattern in terms of method or conclusion lets say among 35 studies try to explain this pattern in 1 paragraph You dont need to write how those authors got the results in detail unless you see a clash between two papers then maybe you can reevaluate their differences in method",1.0,1098

"This was a lovely event worth it for the acting alone especially the remarkable rendition of the scene of Eves awakening

I do think the debate was played too much on Shakespeares terms and turf in part because Prof Smith politely allowed it to stay there Some thoughts
 Biographical silence favours Shakespeare about whom we know relatively little than Milton whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss weakness aspiration perseverance hatred and love This was hardly raised
 So too historical context Shakespeare comes clearly out of an Elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like Marlowe and codeveloped by writers like Jonson Milton obliterates the norms of mid17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism
 Drama favours interiority and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness Milton and most literary history would not have thought it so though the actors brilliantly depicted Ms dramatic imagination in Paradise Lost his goal unlike Shakespeares was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind but to go beyond them His theme is not finally the human but the humaninthecosmos

"Pedro Pramo by the Mexican writer Juan Rulfo is one of the masterpieces of Latin American literature it is considered the novel that inaugurated the literary subgenre of Magical Realism in Latin America
Juan Rulfos work finally gave me the path I was looking for to continue with my books Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel Garca Mrquez confessed in an interview",2.0,371
Magical realism is not from Colombia because the term is European in concoction However when European writers viewed the way Latin American writers wrote they saw it as realism with a splash of magical They viewed these stories through a lens of exotification without realising that its ALL real and that its a description of the absurdities found in Latin American societies If we think about what exotification is its about seeing whats mundane or normalized in one society and treating it as special or unique because one is not used to it Its very much about ignorance and how what we dont understand can often appear magical As a result how these authors chose to tell the story is what mattered This is why magical realism in my opinion does not exist Its a term created in ignorance and perhaps the literary term itself is the most magical part about the whole genre,1.0,896
I read a magical realism text for the first time in a magazine It told the story of three dragons who were adopted by a couple they raised them as if they were human The way the author narrated the passage of their age in childhood adolescence and even adulthood is comical and fantastic at the same time Dragons fight mess do drugs get married divorce and die,2.0,371

Excellent explanation I completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against Eurocentrism but I think its scope is even bigger One aspect of magic realism is politically ideological that is the postcolonial stuff Another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialisticscientific determinism This aspect is more philosophical and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical ie it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes This is just my personal opinion,2.0,678

Why I read and what book I read depends on my mood or my aims Sometimes I read for a bit of escapism Other times its to learn Sometimes its both I love it when a book teaches you something that you never realised or expected and it stays with you and even changes your way of thinking,2.0,292

"I think its down to your mindset There are some truly trash novels in existence but you can read something like Normal People and take something away from it like what your mum said about her crime novels If you have a philosophicalanalyticallearning mindset then any book or even trash reality shows can be good places to apply and challenge your thoughts about other people and contemporary society

A literature degree is a good place to learn to learn and really develop that analytical mindset and how to write essays but this can be accomplished through so many other degrees also",1.0,598
"I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us If the book were reading doesnt wake us up with a blow to the head what are we reading for So that it will make us happy as you write Good Lord we would be happy precisely if we had no books and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to But we need books that affect us like a disaster that grieve us deeply like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves like being banished into forests far from everyone like a suicide A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us That is my belief 
This quote by Kafka perfectly illustrates why we need books to challenge and disrupt us cerebrally If were reading only for entertainment where else in our lives are we finding that sector of learning and stimulation that phenomenal books provide us with",1.0,893
I had forgotten about what it feels like reading a good book since its been awhile I havent taken a English class this semester But your thoughts made me remember All the reasons you talked about reinvigorates my curiosity to think about the human experience question the beliefsmindsets I currently have and well to study literature,2.0,345
I read mostly non fiction books on random topics that interest me Currently  reading a book on artists and architects Since lockdown been watching a lot of documentaries on artists and galleries So I got a book on the topic unfortunately its about 700 pages Which almost put me off but out of pride I couldnt give up Only to become fascinated by how all these buildings that were built for people are no longer there So who do these objects serve This book was written in 2017 with an international look as  these creators to encapsulate both artists and architects In a series of interviews have to explain their method Some are coy but those willing to share open up this view of how they see the world in relation to the notion of space If I understood correctly each creator seeks to capture and reflect this moment in time for future generations to understand their time,1.0,891
When you read a novel how much do you focus on the text vs the background of the author For instance one of my favorite books is The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov If you read it by itself it is such an interesting novel however learning the history of its writing in the background of Stalins Russia makes it even more interesting How much time should we dedicate to looking beyond the four corners if at all,2.0,430
I usually pick up a book for two reasons either because I like to see what it would be like to live in a different reality and that is why I read a lot of fantasy and horror or because I want to know how it is like to live and think as a certain person or in a certain place and time for that is when I go to classics and more international literature Also I totally agree with the people should read classics thing its so cool when you read a classic and finally get this book that keeps being referenced everywhere and you understand why that book has been read for generations,2.0,590

"Here is the Transcript

The literature review is not an essay it is not a research paper  the literature review is part of your essay the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe standalone product if youre masters degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for But regardless of whether part of the research essay or standalone product one thing the literature review does not do is  It doesnt prove state illustrate collaborate or develop your main point thats in the body of your essay The literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper Well what the heck does it do then

Well the literature review is divided into the following key terms first is the whole idea of what the heck in the literature The literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic Now remember I said narrow topic we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic thats the first thing that you need to know The literature is published peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic Second thing the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed What the heck of a review well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it What is that snapshot going to capture That snapshot going to capture major concepts the major point the major outcome the major whatever in that source Its not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot Once you get all those snapshot done you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of timeline situation maybe not but the key years is youre going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element may be on a time line type of situation

Now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why theyre hack are you doing all this stuff Well I think there are three reasons probably why youre doing all this stuffs in school In the first one off course to improve your own understanding as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics  into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding build your background build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline Then in of course in this paper when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject youre going to be demonstrating that knowledge demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment But you know the real purpose of a literature review is its a reader service it something you doing as a favor for your readers what are you doing you are bringing them up to date

Whats the first thing you and that old friend do You ask each other hey what you been doing all these years Fill me in update me you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in you updating them By bringing them up to date then you can start at the present again  You see what Im saying you can bring them along that timeline of the path letting them know the key element the major concepts the key element in your life and what you dare Boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literatures review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas past scholars the past researchers boom and then come your idea",0.0,3872

Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 103
Sundays went to church on Mondays watched a movie
Soon youll be alone sorry that you have to lose me

Wayne is the kind of success story that encourages me as a underground artist with a small following Seeing how hes developed his skills and slowly blown up after seizing each and every opportunity hes been giving has been inspirational Mans has quickly become a mainstay in the industry and for good reason Dude is too nice I know if I put in the work I can reach a larger audience some day too but for now Im happy being a supporter My turn will come too Salute to Wayne,2.0,484

"I think this probably resonates with all of us who have been single a while after  being in a serious relationship

You get yourself into situations with people you like but couldnt get serious with Both playing a slight game with each other You like each other But dont need each other Both wanting to give each other late night calls Sometimes resisting 

You feel all strong and happy to be independent all day enjoying life come home make yourself some food but come 89pm you often realise you actually dont wanna be alone that night again and damn you should have arranged something with someone But now its maybe too late",2.0,646

For those confused about the Pythagorean theorem its the method used to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle from the two side lengths The formula is a2  b2  c2

"Good summation My only disagreement is with the part where you say investors chose bbby in Jan 21 because it was highly shorted
 My understanding is its part of a basket of stocks all shorted with the same instrument and all retail companies Movie theatre used game store towels and when GME went parabolic the covering that occurred on that single security pushed up the whole basket I cant talk for other investors but very little of the rest of the basket was mentioned on Reddit prior to the last week of Jan 21 
Sure since becoming bagholders people think its a movement but to start with it was a value play When I went long gme was 918 pre split with 12 book value When I went long bbby it was 498 with huge call option interest at 5 and Ryan Cohen had skin in the game 
Its fine playing meme stocks but I suggest getting in when the chatter is low and if Ryan Cohen is involved make sure your cost basis is less than his ",1.0,952

as an ex flight attendant this is INCREDIBLY detailed especially the safety demo gave me flashbacks I wish I had been able to give the demo in a way as calming as you were,2.0,176
I love how when Gibi asks for options she doesnt specify which one we pick For example she asks Which one would you like then she says Okay perfect and no matter what someone picks it seems really interactive Also love the attention to detail with the airplane cups  Thanks so much for the relaxation and content you provide for us 3,2.0,347
Id love a Everything is wrong version of this with us the viewers being the only ones on the flight and were in a rusty old plane that could drop at any given point Perhaps Daisy could be the flight attendant,2.0,217
Fun fact Most aeroplanes have above head cabins for the crew to sleeprest in during flights thats why you might not see a specific crew member for a certain amount of time theyre probably up there My mom is a Flight Attendant so I get all this information from her dont worry its the real stuff,1.0,309

Latte would you ever consider doing a behind the scenes of your ASMR filming process I am so fascinated by how detailed your sets are how perfect you make them and how you embody every aspect of the role youre playing for these ASMR videos Its incredible Id love to see a behind the scenes of you setting up and filming I think many others would too ,2.0,362
latte is so incredible i am a teen and struggle with anxiety depression ocd adhd paranoia body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria ptsd and dissociative issues as well as chronic pain so it is usually very difficult for me to feel relaxed and fall asleep i discovered latte two years ago and it changed my life she is so soothing and comforting without being condescending annoying or repetitive and her videos are always incredibly high quality ive watched all of her videos including the ones in languages i dont understand and there wasnt a single video i didnt like i love and appreciate latte so much 33,2.0,626

This woman is one of the few asmr tists who got exactly the concept and mastered the practice Some asmrtists as fine as they are do not have the sensibility to sometimes avoid some triggers or noises that can actually bother the most sensitive listeners There are patterns of sounds which means some sounds will cause relaxation other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers dont realize that these cannot be mixed Me for an example hate very high pitched noises hate plastic and eating sounds Latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos She just knows whats up,0.0,611
Whenever you tell us to breathe in and breathe out it INSTANTLY relaxes me You are the only ASMR person that has given me complete relaxation in such a simple manner Your voice is just perfect for this,2.0,207

"Is There Anybody Out There	lyrics

 	I climb the rooftops every morning
And search for life there down below
But there is nothing out there for me
There is nothing out there to see
I send a signal for survivors
Requesting help on where to go
But there is nobody else to hear
The only answer I get is fear

Cause every time that I return to this place I once called home
Yes every time the walls cry out youre the last one  youre alone

Oh  is there anybody out there
There must be someone else like me
Oh  is there anybody out there in the cold
Come raise your voice and set me free

I wander streets that once were crowded
Im searching houses that were homes
But there is nothing out there for me
There is nothing out there to see
Im fighting off the dread that haunts me
But in my empty heart it grows
Cause there is nobody else to hear
The only answer I get is fear

And every time I raise my head panic stares me in my face
Yes every time I try to think I get trapped inside a maze

Oh  is there anybody out there
There must be someone else like me
Oh  is there anybody out there in the cold
Come raise your voice and set me free

Oh  is there anybody out there
There must be someone else like me
Oh  is there anybody out there in the cold
Come raise your voice and set me free",0.0,1383

"POT FARMER DANCE SONG 
I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot
You better believe it held a whole lot
I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame
Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain

I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes
They did nothing but give me regrets
My mom had arthritis could not walk around
I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground

I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack
 After I smoked some to me it came back
Soon I decided prices were high
I searched for some ground I wouldnt have to buy

I bargained for seeds from smokers all around
 Got in my truck and drove out of town
I walked through the woods where wild birds nest
 Found me the meadow I thought was the best

I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds
Said a small prayer for strong healthy weeds
I watered at night with a fivegallon pail
 Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil

Seven months went by I thought I would die
Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky
At night I went out in a camouflage suit
 Used my corn knife to chop down the loot

I hung it up to dry where it couldnt be found
Came back and got it when it had turned brown
I trimmed off the buds stuffed them in bags
Called all my friends and passed out free drags

In less than a week my crop was gone
 I flew to St Thomas with a love hungry blonde

Natutulala sa nakakaakitakit

Hindi ko alam kung saan ko sisimulan
Binibigyang kulay ang larawan na para bang
Ikaw ang nagiisang bituin
Nagsisilbing buwan na kapiling mo
Sa likod ng mga ulap
Ang tayo lamang ang tanging magaganap
Ibon sa paligid umaawitawit
Natutulala sa nakakaakitakit mong tinatangi

Im ChineseAustralian and I started thinking about what my ideal comfort food would be when I started watching this video It turned out that I had a very similar experience with the Chinese lady in this video as well My parents sometimes made congee with cabbage and chicken in the morning and it was the best meal I could ever have wanted I also requested this when I was sick and also when I got braces on because I could only eat soft foods It really shows just how nice this mixture of rice and water really is,2.0,523

"Being British the best comfort food is at Chinese takeaway their bbq sweet ribs are PERFECT they fall off the bone and you get to eat the sweet crunchy cartilage and if  you like it the bone marrow its perfect to eat and the sauce in the tub left over in thick and sweet and perfect for the chips they sell that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside Hope I described it well

As someone who grew up in New Jersey I do love salt water taffy  But sub sandwiches are the real iconic food from NJ  The term submarine sandwich was coined in my hometown of Paterson by an Italian immigrant thanks Wikipedia  White House Subs in Atlantic City is one of the Jersey Shores oldest sub shops and of course the Jersey Mikes chain started from in Pt Pleasant   Yes your local deli probably makes a better sandwich But JMs subs are at least far superior to Subway,2.0,494

"The thing that was not mentioned in the video is that there are two Mcdonalds in India North and East zone run by connaught foods and south and west run by Hardcastle foods The menus for both of them are different meaning each of them have their own exclusives I think Nikhil was having the south and west mcdonalds They have a bigger menu compared to North and East

Indian laws donot allow foreign companies to hold 100 of business in India They are required to partner up with a local company
so
McDonalds partners with connaught foods and Hardcastle foods
Dominos with jubilant foods
Yum brands partner with Devyani International Sapphire Foods and more recently Burman Hospitality
Starbucks with TATA coffees 
etc

so the local companies do get a say in the menus which is why the menus may be different at different places in India",1.0,850
what nikhil says from 2300 is absolutely right it might seem its cheap to the foreign viewers but in reality it is actually quite expensive for the indian population,1.0,170
"There are actually 2 extremely different McDonalds menus in India I am from north India and over there most of the things are different from the menu shown in the video

"I love how brutal the commentary is in this one Its about time somebody puts Dominos in its place I never really understood why people like them so much but to each their own I guess Its just too bad they have no appreciation on what qualifies as food worth paying for

Dominos India have deteriorated a lot over the years their cheese burst doesnt burst anymore stuffed garlic bread doesnt have cheese in it and most importantly they dont use cheese anymore its all vegoil based cheese substitute Even their customer care and store staffs are not as good as before I used to love Dominos before but now its a nightmare,0.0,366
Ive been living in India for almost 10 years now and prefer its pizzas much over the Western menu I still remember my first year in India seeing a big dominos ad where theyd advertise two new pizzas with exotic vegetables the exotic vegetables being broccoli and zuccini goes to show that exotic is very much a question of perspective ,2.0,345
FYIwe also have Garlic Breadsticks Stuffed Garlic BreadCheese Dominator1 pound of mozzarella cheese melted on the pizza5 cheese pizza1 out of those 4 cheeses is a Ghost Pepper flavoured cheeseParatha PizzaRed Velvet Lava Cake and Butterscotch Mousse Cakewhich is the most heavenly thing available on the whole Dominos menu but its also true that these items are region specific thats why it is there in KolkataWest Bengal but not in Bangalore,2.0,457

When I lived in Japan about 17 years ago MacDonalds had a burger called the McGrand It had a creamy Dijon mustard sauce and a thick beef patty along with lettuce tomatoes and so on It was so good that I still think about it occasionally I was really disappointed when I moved back to Canada and it wasnt on the menu here,2.0,329
The Japanese packaging is cute Im also surprised Mcfloats arent a thing here But the ice cream machines are always down so maybe thats a factor,2.0,150

Edited for grammar",2.0,413
Incredible job on that video He is an icon to local food and has been pushing hard to promote the industry I think you found the right man to introduce Singapore hawker food I saved almost 90 on my flights using Mighty  Travels  Premium,2.0,241

So apparently the Japanese 7Elevens are like mini togo restaurants while the ones in the US serve packaged processed food or reheated frozen processed garbage Its almost an insult to call them the same store how do we let them get away with this crap here,0.0,264
I dont think Ive ever seen such a stark difference in selection and quality on a Food Wars ep before lol,1.0,106
Theres no comparison between US 7 Elevens and the 711 in Asia Dramatic difference on quality of food and service For ppl who live in the US and want to experience the Asia 711s go to Hawaii 711s are run by different companies in Asia which explains the significant difference As an American I barely go to 711 except if I need a drink Food is mostly unedible unless ur drunk high or dont care,0.0,408
It seems in this series that George enjoys what he eats WAY more than Joe does 3,2.0,82
Im upset that Japans 711 has actual proper food where we have nothing but junk food Anyways Im excited that you guys are branching out to India,2.0,150
Me as a European am always so surprised about the drink sizes in the US How can the smallest soda be 651ML That would in the Netherlands be enough for the entire family I mean in Japan they have 1l and 15 liter packages but they are clearly to pour in glasses and share they arent portion sized,0.0,308

I love how it took more time for him to eat popcorn than a whole entire chocolate cake,2.0,86
The thing that I love about him is he doesnt waste food and his thumbnails are real,2.0,84

I love how his son let his dad rage at him knowing he needed to do it and being proud that he did it,2.0,102
I ate here as a kid before during and after the filming of this episode My dad is vegan so we went here often The food was always great and the son was who my family usually interacted with he was always super nice You could imagine my surprise when I got older and saw this episode lol I never saw Gordon Ramsay but I saw the son and staff being interviewed one of the times my family went for breakfast The potato pancake was my favorite on the menu Its a shame the restaurant was sold and no longer exists,2.0,519
This man is a very gentle soul Its hard for him to get angry,2.0,62
this is a really good episode lots of great moments the son getting excited about his dad standing up for himself the owner secretly shaking the pan while handcuffed the owner eating the plants straight from the pot a fun time,2.0,233
So wonderful to see that guy love his Dad so much that he wasnt even disturbed with his Dad yelling at him recognised that it was apart of his Dads growth as a manager and got so excited by it happening,2.0,207
The owner in this episode is such a sweetheart bless his heart Its sad that some of his staff take advantage of that Im so glad Gordon came to help and I hope they clean up their act and kick it into gear  I really hope that after Gordon leaves that Dean will continue to put his foot down and have the restaurant and life he deserves To be completely honest the cook showed promise but he didnt show up half of the time when he needed to and didnt listen to Dean and wants to say Dean is a bad manthats ridiculous Dean put up with Orelio cookchef thinking he can do what he wants mainly Deans own fault and so now that is what he expects I would have fired his ass a long time ago,1.0,705
The son of the owner was very well spoken and respectful I really loved how he was honest with his dad but also showed a caring side as well,2.0,142

"Im going to comment this on every potato video  To simplify the destarching of your potato whether its for chips fries hash browns or whatever use a solidbottom salad spinner  Fill it with water swish your potato pieces lift out the basket and dump and refill the water until its clear  Then dump the water and spin the potatoes  You will get them super dry in just a minute  Then you can lay them out on a kitchen towel or paper towel but this will save you paper towels because they will be dry
Of course there is no reason you must use my technique  After all you are the Johnny Depp of your Potato Prep  Enjoy",1.0,641
I have been coming back Chef Johns recipes then and again for years Theres always great nuggets of advice and reasons to chuckle in these videos Thank you once again Chef,2.0,178
Im allergic to sunflower seeds and most storebought potato chips are cooked in sunflower oil so this opens up my life to potato chips Thank you Chef John,2.0,159
The only problem is avoiding eating the first batch while the second cooks I place my chips on parchment without the dinner plate I also toss them in oil without rinsing them My 1100w microwave takes 3 minutes per batch Also you can get a variance of 50 with the time required depending on the potato itself Always keep an eye on it and never assume the time will be the same,1.0,383
Chef John  from beef wellington to potato chips in the microwave the man does it all,2.0,87
"I had to come back to say this works great I used olive oil spray though and Lawrys season salt but same result Very crunchy Only 6 minutes in my micro so as Chef John said watch them because everyones micro is different
Also kudos to the parchment paper trick to cut it round But I think I did one too many folds because I ended up with 2 parchment paper circles attached together  ",2.0,395
These look amazing  I hate the fact that store bought crisps Im watching from the UK or chips are broken up into little pieces due to handling I guess Thanks for sharing,2.0,174

"Philipino cuisine is criminally underrated Im Mexican American from So California and believe it or not I went my first 23 years of my life never having had the pleasure of trying it outside of a few random delicious desserts from my aunts filipina coworkers Wasnt until I started dating a half Filipina half white girl I first got to try it at a legit restaurant I absolutely loved EVERYTHING My family would always tease me for putting vinegar and salt on pretty much anything and when I realized spicy vinegar was a normal everyday table condiment I felt like I found my long lost relatives haha That alone would have been enough for me but then dessert absolutely sealed the deal HALOHALO Are you kidding me filipinos That is crack cocaine in dessert form And everything else All of the sweet sticky rice flour balls filled with coconut and ube purple sweet yam and taro 

I love my Mexican food and while I wouldnt ever trade it for anything filipino food seriously gives it a run for its money in my opinion",2.0,1036

That movie theater butter flavor is thanks to something called butter salt brand name Flavicol  The compounds that give butter its buttery taste can be made artificially or extracted from actual butter then mixed with salt as a powder  This is then mixed with oil and thats what movie theaters use  You should dry age with the pure Flavicol powder  I bet thatd be incredible,2.0,389

"Popcorn oil is amazing 

I used to work at a movie theater and wed pop the kernels by adding one pump of oil into the hopper One day I added a second pump of oil and the popcorn was amazing Perfect golden color savory delicious People complimented how good the popcorn was I became the guy responsible for making all the popcorn One day I showed a coworker my secret and he thought if 2 pumps of oil is better than 1 then 6 must be amazing We received so many complaints over his oily popcorn Had to throw the whole batch out in giant garbage bags The lesson a little oil goes a long way dont overdo it with that stuff ",2.0,639

"In WW2 when the Americans liberated the concentration camp SaintCyprien located in France The American troops wanted to feed the newly freed Camp Prisoners because they have been starving 

Without knowing what would happen if they would feed them heavy food literally seconds after liberating them The soldiers thinking it was the right thing started giving the Prisoners Apples Sandwiches and even Chocolates 
Leading to a lot of Prisoners dying

After that incident the Science team gave out an order to not feed the prisoners in the camps and to let the Medical Staff feed them first
It was mostly a slow input of light soup",0.0,646
The fact that Jimmy talked about refeeding syndrome and had a bunch of medical experts on standby really shows the precautions he takes behind the scenes Hes really serious about doing these challenges and definitely should be taken inspiration for a lot of people,2.0,267
Theres a story on YouTube about a crew of Japanese sailors who shipwrecked on an island and went a few weeks without food They were eventually rescued by an American ship and the captain was extremely strict with what the starving crew ate Making sure they only ate small amounts of soup Ship captains in the 1800s clearly knew how to deal with starvation And it goes to show how easily knowledge can be lost,0.0,415
One could say Gordans food is to die for,0.0,43
My grandmother told me this story Were from the Philippines and during the end of WWII during and at the exit of the Japanese occupation the US military started to air drop supplies to the civilians including food One of my grandmothers neighbors a young boy picked up a can of corned beef and ate it straight from opening the box of supplies He dropped dead moments after At the time my grandmother thought he died from choking to death but later realized it must have been refeeding syndrome,0.0,505
I just feel the need to say as someone diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa I appreciate you Mat for bringing light to the dangers and science of them,2.0,145
Slight correction Pretty sure Gordan didnt know MrBeast was fasting until he literally started cooking for him He probably would not have even started cooking if he knew By the time he started he definitely has the pride of a chef to have his target audience enjoy his food,1.0,279
1315 just a quick correction there Jimmy did do it for the content but he stated in the comments it was also because he has Crohns disease which means he has a nasty amount of gut inflammation He wanted to know if fasting would help with the inflammation,0.0,260
I was in a pretty bad accident when I was younger spent about 3 weeks in ICU hooked up to a nutrients IV and could only drink water with a straw while stuck in bed I still remember the first time I tried to eat solid food after that It was a little microwave Kraft Dinner cup I took one bite and immediately was hit with a wave of nausea to the point and nearly vomited right there in my hospital bed I havent really been able to eat plain KD since then ,0.0,462
This is probably my favourite food theory video to date This information could save lives of people who fast whether voluntarily or not As someone who has unfortunately been in a position of not being able to acquire food I really appreciate this information There had been times in which I went a few days without food only to try and stuff myself I only ever felt sick and knowing its my bodys natural response is a huge perspective change,2.0,452

Looks great  The bakery where I work makes blueberry cornmeal muffins  for dairy we use sour cream rather than milkbuttermilk and we also add a little lemon zest and vanilla but otherwise very similar  Someone has maybe already commented this but we also toss the blueberries with one reserved cup for a recipe of this size probably a couple teaspoons or a tablespoon would be perfect of the dry ingredients before mixing them in to keep them from sinking  Blueberries and cornmeal make a great combo,2.0,510
You can try coating the berries with flour before you mix them in The flour coating on them slows down how fast they fall to the bottom of the pan The same goes for things like chocolate chips,1.0,195
Its a common trick in a lot of baking circles to toss the fresh fruit with a little bit of flour before stirring in the fruit to your baked item So for a pound of blueberries perhaps toss them together with about two tablespoons of flour which should keep them suspended in the batter as it bakes,1.0,303
Im upset about other things in my life and Im still confident that I would love these and not complain about blueberry placement,2.0,133
Perfect timing We have two blueberry bushes that give us about 2 gallons of blueberries every summer tomorrow the picking begins and will continue for at least two weeks cant wait to try this recipe,2.0,203
This looks so delicious Cant wait to try it,2.0,46
Ive heard a good way to keep berries from sinking is to coat lightly in flour before adding them into the batter,2.0,114
I call the sweet style cornbread breakfast cornbread cause when its paired with a glass of milk or cup of coffee it makes a great breakfast Im gonna try adding blueberries to my next batch,2.0,194

Im really impressed by how clean your oven looks And of course your blueberry cornbread which looks heavenly Cant wait to try this recipe,2.0,144

"Okay this gonna be a long one sorry about that

Im French and theres an interesting fact about France its that we are brutally honest Most other people dont like that so we are called arrogant rude obnoxious but we are not we are just honest and people dont like honesty When we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other its not because we cheat more than you its just because we honestly answered the questions Youre probably wondering where Im going with that

Well I was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other not staying friends with each other yadayadayada and I cant relate At all Because it doesnt work like that here I still know a lot of female who were already friend in High School and Im 40 whenever I see my mother or my Girlfriend or my Girl Friends they are just friendly

I dunno its probably only on screen but the number of time I saw in TV shows or movies a group of girls being friendly then as soon as one leave they all turn to bitch on this one thats something I never saw in France They bitch on her while she is here and she doesnt take it badly because she does the same

So I was wondering why is that  Why are they still friends if its different for others then I realized because we are honest

My female friends wont hesitate to look at each others and say Wow girl you look like shit today Didnt you put on weight recently Maybe you should work out and for me thats a healthy relationship

Why does American males manage to stay friends  Because they trash talk each other because they are honest because they say things as they are Yeah sometimes we have fallouts but we mend things

Why cant female American stay friends  Because they are sneaky they lie Ooooh you look gorgeous girl You are so strong I envy you while not thinking any of that Sooner or later in any relationship based on lie the truth will come out and its not going to be pretty",0.0,2037

This one also looks promising because the directors are same and Hrithik looks fine as always Also excited because the BGM is done by Sam CS who is an underrated music director who composed music for the original Vikram Vedha Will need to check the songs done by VishalShekhar who are also good music directors Excited for the trailer,2.0,341

This got me so hyped especially Hrithik being the highlight for me Also the it factor for me was to see such a diverse talented cast and the bgm as well Achara saying that it wasnt convincing actually makes me believe that shes just still adjusting to seeing Hrithik in a negative role because those eyes stood out for me giving that maniac sadistic vibe that it was supposed to And the background setting of Imambara from Lucknow though,2.0,449
"The movie is based on one of the Panchatantra stories of VikramRaja Vikramadityavedhaghost 
theme is where the raja is haunted by the ghost and it tells raja one story and asks questions at the end of each story And based on the answer the ghost will take action

"A lot of people are missing the reason why Hrithik went in different direction to Vedhas character than Sethupathis calm  composed 

Vikram Vedha is based on old Indian folk talemythology of VikramBetaalBaital from BaitalPachisi Betaal is described as a creaturemonster who questions king Vikramadityas strong sense of justice Betaal is little bit crazy and inhuman addressing Acharas concern and thats the vibe Im getting from Hrithiks Vedhas unlike Sethupathi They are going more traditional route and Hrithik didnt copy Amitabhs character from Agneepath either 

Honestly I like the approach original creators and Hrithik took for this one",1.0,672

"This movies actually a play on the 1940s film noir style of filmmaking  movies like The Maltese Falcon The Big Sleep or later on stuff like Chinatown about a jaded detective  starting what seems like a simple case to pay the bills but quickly spirals into a complex web of competing parties where just when youve got it all figured out a new piece of info puts everything into a totally different light

So basically the movie is about how a scenario like that would play out if the detective was an aging hippy with no sense of selfmotivation who is completely unqualified to deal with it 

At the time it came out people compared it to their previous film Fargo which while it had distinctly Minnesotan humor it was still a serious truecrime story in the end But comparison The Big Lebowski is a lot sillier and plays around a lot more with genre while ultimately having a story thats about nothing and people didnt like it 
It became whats known as a cult classic after it came out on home video when all the couch potatoes gave it a second chance",1.0,1088

"My theory here

 That plant creature could possibly be that Fungus but in a more mutated form As seen previously in the Missing Persons and  Autopsy Report videos whenever someone dies in the Backrooms they get covered in this black coloured fungus This fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto mutating itself onto the dead body Given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate 100 1000 or even millions of years at best and also given that how time passes strangely in the Backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the Informational video with the date 291990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished however it wasnt teleportation but instead time travel That researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the Presentation video with the date 581990 when the alarm rang out and CCTV footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by Async So by this logic the whenever someone dies in the Backrooms the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time The creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash As seen in Kanes secret video of 9780415263573 this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed the driver wasnt able to push the brakes in time to stop the car Thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage The driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there The fungus grew on him and later the entire room in its mutated form Also it sounded like the creature was yelling out Help in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room which was seen in the original found footage video and later the Pitfalls video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of its last victims and in this case even its originator which is the driver Its all just a theory which I just came up with Dont take it canon lol",0.0,2357

So I think that the backrooms was making a new nest for the entity

"No sequel to a movie that is over 30 years old should be this damn spectacular I saw this opening night in IMAX and it was one of the absolute best moviegoing experiences of my life The sound of the jets flying by the literal feeling of the vibrations in your seat when the G forces kick in and especially the visuals of seeing everything from the point of view of the pilots I legitimately believed during the final dogfight that Maverick was going to die so few movies today make me believe that

On top of all that the story is so freaking amazing The theme of showing how fighter pilots are still needed even in the age of drones the story of Rooster learning to not just forgive Maverick but to let go of being so overly careful in his flying and dont think just fly And of course the most emotionally powerful if the movie when Maverick visits Iceman Even though he has retired due to his throat cancer and has difficulty speaking he still managed to give an absolutely heartbreaking performance

"House of the Dragon is inspired by Georges book called Fire and Blood which tells the story of what was known as one of the most violent wars and power struggles within the Game of Thrones universe the tragic fight was called  The Dance of Dragons and this event takes place 100 years before Daenerys
The funny thing about the book is that it is a kind of book within the universe itself thats because The Dance of Dragons was a historical event and when reading the book as it is written the impression one gets is that any inhabitant of Westeros could go to the library and read the same book telling about what led to the dance of the dragons to happen
And yes it was just a book that tells about this event and it is already finished so for the series we can expect less seasons than GOT and a more complete story different from the ending of got that was not written by George since the books still are not finished but all the characters of House of the dragon were created by him as well as the basis of the story although some things can and will have some changes

Hope i helpedxx",1.0,1113
Targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams The only reasons the house survived the doom of Valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to Dragonstone Even in Game of Thrones Dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs Thats why she did it This is the problem with watching this show and criticizing certain characters without having any book context at all,0.0,454

Also I hear this series will be far more morally grey than Game of Thrones ever was Daemon gives me Ramsay or Joffrey vibes but hell be much more complex and less villainous While he seems to operate on selfmotivation his violence isnt wanton or random like Joffrey or Ramsay So I picture him being closer to a CerseiJaime style character But if anything he absolutely gives PEAK Targaryen vibes and Matt Smith gives a stellar performance

Im really excited to see Corlys Valaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen A shame we havent seen much of Rhaenys but I picture her having some of Cerseis chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown I hate to touch on this but I know Corlyss racial change was of concern and I originally had slight concern myself Not because some OMG WOKE bs but because of the Velaryons and the Targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation so I prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one But if you think about it the light complexion of the Targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins Furthermore Valyria was awfully close to the Summer Isles and Sothoryos So to me Corlys is more what I would envision the original Valyrians would look like so it doesnt bother me in the slightest Especially after seeing him on screen He seems like a GREAT character already and I think and hope hes up there with Davos

 Otto Hightower gives strong Tywin and Littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all He does seem like a type of manofhonor but more in the sense of being a strict rulefollower stuck in the old ways

And then obviously Viserys is the Ned Stark of the series I LOVE seeing that name reclaimed And while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity Im glad he apologized to Rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her I especially like that when brought up with the council the first response was Theres never been a queen but one of the others was quick to chime in with Only out of precedent and tradition Its nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has hah but shes a WOMAN Maybe Rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had

Also while the age difference between him and Alicent is a little insane and I dont like Otto pimping out his daughter like that I do think they would legitimately treat each other well Probably erring on the side of Viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it

Most of all the show felt like we jumped straight into S3 or S4 of Game of Thrones",0.0,3296

This AveMaria composed by Igor Krutoy Sang by Dimash As you see this song is amazing ,2.0,87
"The composer of this is the piano player Igor Krutoy He came out of semiretirement to work with Dimash He has composed for people like Lara Fabian and Andrea Bocelli 

Igor wrote a post about this song on his IG

One evening about three months before the New Wave Dimash called me and asked if I could write Ave Maria  for him explaining that he wanted to sing something in that style Coincidentally I had a free evening and I gladly sat down at the piano and remembering the Italian formula of responsibility worked with inspiration until I achieved the desired result   After taking a few days for the composition to rest in my ears soul and heart I sent it to Dimash who literally within half an hour answered that it was exactly what he wanted to hear And of course the reception and applause given to Dimash by the audience at the New Wave show what a happiness it is to do what I love to write for such a genius singer to evoke deep emotion in the audience and to be in demand Just a short essay on  What is happiness",2.0,1064
Me dio risa cuando estaban hablando y rindose antes de que Dimash abriera la boca y emitiera el primer sonido Se quedaron mudos Esta es la capacidad que tiene Dimash de cautivar al pblico sin decir una sola palabra Es maravilloso esta es una composicin de Igor Krutoy especialmente para Dimash no tiene letra para que las personas de cualquier credo puedan disfrutarla y vaya que lo logra Gracias por su sincera admiracin al magnifico Dimash ,2.0,455
This vocalise of Ave Maria was composed by Igor Krutoy especially for Dimash  It goes without saying that this newest version of the traditional songs is almost beyond belief in its simplicity and power  Nobody can pull off a vocalise as well as Dimash the greatest vocalist I have ever heard in my 80 years on this planet and Ive heard some really great singers along the way and in every genre ever conceived  What a blessing to experience this voice this incomparable talent  btw Very nice reaction,2.0,517

"Hes not younger This was 2021 Hes was 27 at the time Same as Stranger and Fly Away
This is an original composed version of Ave Maria by Igor Krutoy per Dimashs request It does share some similarities with the Caccini composition and might have been the inspiration
Some have posited that because Igor is Jewish and Dimash is Muslim they may have opted to forego the lyrics for this reason which would make sense Again I dont believe that has been confirmed by either one",1.0,485

"Among the parts of the Indonesian anthem included by Novia Bachmid
 1  Lingsir wengi comes from the island of Java especially central Java
 2  Cik Cik Periuk comes from the Sambas West Kalimantan
 3  Sinanggar Tulo came from Northern Sumatra
 4  Ayo Mama from the Maluku islands
 5  Anging Mammiri came from South Sulawesi
 6  Lalo Ngaro came from Sasak Lombok East
 7  Tanduk Majeng came from the Madura islands
 8  The last of our national anthem from Indonesia was the one of Mengheningkan Cipta Shanna Shannon sang in white between the flames
The one moment of silence Shannon has sung in memory of all the services our former heroes have fallen before us The song we used to sing any at the time of the red and white flag ceremony The song creeps us out every time we listen to it

The bird that flies over that hill is also the symbol of our country Indonesia Its Garuda bird
The eagles state symbol also has a particular meaning
 1  The Garuda has our countrys symbol Indonesia
 2  The Garudas hoof clings to a single Bhinneka Tunggal Ika when it comes from the book of Sotasoma by the Tantular Emphatti that has different meanings but one is also tribe religion culture and language
 3  The golden yellow represents majesty constantly charging high in the dignity of a people of great and lofty character
 4  The number of feathers on the right and left wing is 17 which means the 17th day our country has been free from Dutch and Japanese rule for 350 years
 5  Tail feathers of 8 have the sense of August when we celebrate independence day
 6  Below the chain of shields connecting with the tail is the number 19 feather and the hair on the neck 45 showing the figure of 1945 in which our country of Indonesia was free from the Dutch and Japanese rule in 1945

The instrument is called Sasando and the hat is called Tii Langga Both are Rote Island Nusa Tenggara Timur 

Alffy Rev says that the production of a video clip of the Wonderland Indonesia 2 times will take about 8 months and early in the song there are Kecak dancers involved with up to 300

It is true that we didnt hear Daemon said The Heir For A Day and his account might be true after all when he said we each mourn our own ways We are only told via Ottos report and we know they despised each other The labeling could be interpreted in either good or bad way Just like the title The Queen Who Never Was could be considered a mockery but also it could mean you acknowledge that she should be the queen Maybe Daemon is indeed honoring his dead nephew One thing is for sure though i think his love for his brother is genuine however rogue his ways are He knows his brother is weak and he sees Otto Hightower for what he is he really wanted to protect his brother from crows thats waiting for a feast Hes definitely going to be a grey character and they tend to be the most interesting,1.0,814

"After the foul taste the original GoT left in my mouth I didnt have very high hopes for this Yet I watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons maybe not quite there yet but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it

I find it hard to pinpoint Daemon on the one hand he wants to show strength the city watch part but then hes also arrogant the tournament claiming victory while the fight wasnt over and straight up horrible heir for a day But on the other hand he really cares for Rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her her father would need him more now than ever before which shows he also cares for Viserys I think him calling Viserys weak was his blunt way of telling Viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king which is in line with what he did with the city watch he feels like the king should show his strength

Viserys seems like hes held things together for those 9 years but this clearly is coming to an end I feel like hes made a huge mistake by alienating Daemon this wont make things easy for Rhaenyra who already has to fight the fact that some people dont want a woman on the throne In the end I think it will be between those two and Viserys will be long gone from the picture",0.0,1282
"They referenced the White Walker prophecy at the end When the King was talking to his daughter Seems its a warning passed from king to king Little did they know it took 172 years to come to pass And the King even says A Targaryen has to be on the throne to win that Cold War
Yes its rumored the throne rejects those who arent worthy by cutting them
This whole series will show us how such a powerful family like the Targaryens become the died off long lost house we see in Season 1 of GoT When Daenerys was with her brother cast out and ridiculed 
So were gonna see what they did to themselves to become that so low and from 10 dragons on total around in this series to Dragons no longer even exist In GoT and are old rumors 
Each Targaryen pairs with a dragon either a new one or one passes down from a deceased relative There are young and old dragons dragon eggs trainers and keepers So cool",1.0,917
Pretty sure that daemon didnt actually say the heir for a day even in the books its implied that Otto might have made it up to drive a wedge between the brothers and daemon just didnt want to say anything at that moment He is vile but he has his brothers best intentions in mind for sure,0.0,295

Going through the video after watching the live session that Lakshya did before this video made me realise his unshined  talent that had yet to come to light in ACTING the difference is his pitch language body language taking  thing like I will file a case for granted really shows his supremacy and how much of an alpha he is it really reminds me of the Aparichit  the person who was in his YouTube video and the person who was in his in his live almost feel like they were two different individuals  I dont support anyone of them prince and his wife had milked there child and they not tackled any of the allegation he was just taking out his anger making personal comments but I cant just blind eye on things that Lakshya said just because Im his subscriber and this had cleared that the past allegation like ganging up bulling were some how true  Lakshya portraying an image of the person that he is not thinking we should not abuse in YouTube because its an public platform and spread hate but can make an abusive live video on Insta I guess Insta is not a public platform anymore and its strike one thing that  lakshay is not abuse because of the problem that he had faced in his past for making that kind of content,1.0,1238

The best part about the teaser is that both Hrithik and Saif look drastically different from R Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi And very honestly Hrithiks Vedha is looking slightly more menacing than Vijays Im cautious but highly excited at the same time Im quite hopeful towards this movie coz the directors of the original have made this as well and if Im not wrong theyve said it ISNT a scene to scene remake Hopefully optimistic ,2.0,440
Im from Chennai but Im a big fan of Hrithik and dont tell me its a remake its a beautiful script which is worth to be filmed again  and Im glad Hrithik is doing the villain role,2.0,186

Chalo Mai bhi likh deta hu PJ never disappoints   btw sach mein nhi karta ye banda disappoint ,1.0,94
You should watch the original movie featuring R Madhavan and Vijay sethupati its a masterpiece ,2.0,101
First time after a long time after Kabir Singh this look promising I watched original I dont want to know about story line i just want to see the Maniac and dense acting of these two,2.0,188
Its directed by original director so hell yeah Im gonna watch it,2.0,66
I love the original Tamil movie The Tamil version solidified Vijay Sethupathy as my favorite actor The whole concept of setting up the story in the Vikram Vetal backdrop was so unique The climax fight Vedha has a come what may unhinged chaotic attitude and the crazy banter between Vikram and Vedha during the fight  it was absolutely fresh to look at Personally I love both Saif and Hrithik I really dont want to compare VJS and Hrithik Ill be honest I was skeptical about the remake But the teaser does look promising I love Hrithiks attempt at being the unhinged Vedha Except for the accent as you rightly pointed out the teaser does look promising Even though the bgm is very good I was just hearing the bgm from the original in my head I do miss it I really really really hope and pray this movie does well,2.0,847
Theres this eccentricity in Hrithiks eyes that tells me hell do full justice to this role He has his own unique style and wont be just mimicking Vijay Sethupathy I have faith in this movie because of the makers really looking forward to it People just have to approach it with an open mind rather than being so negative even before the release,2.0,354
The only thing thats exciting me in this film is Hrithiks portrayal of a gray shaded character Hrithik Roshan mostly cuz the guy is just so good but in these kind of roles it always just fascinates me to watch one of my favorite actors to perform,2.0,251
"That Sam CS BGM towards the end gave me massive goosebumps
VishalShekar and Sam are gonna kill with the soundtrack",2.0,124
The only thing that matters is box office Hrithiks Agneepath was a box office hit and his Vijay is totally different from Amitabhs Vijay If he can succeed in making a new Vijay then I dont know why people are saying cant match Vijay Sethupati All that matters is box office rest people will always criticize no matter if its actually great,1.0,348
Initially      When I heard that Hrithik Roshan is playing role of Veda I doubted if he could fit into that role which Vijay Sethu Pathi immortalized that CharacterAfter watching the Teaser I am surprised and excited to see Veda in this remake version Congratulations to both Heroes Hrithik Roshan and ofcourse  Vikram role is tailor made for Saif ali Khan ,2.0,362
Fully agree with you regarding that scene where Vedha Hrithik is smiling devilishly while spraying bullets People have the habit of complaining  and most of the people who are complaining they have not even watched the Original VV And yes Hrithik did not copy Amitabh and similarly here he did not copy the Great VS,0.0,327
In orginal movie and trailer specifically both Vikram and Vedha were projected to be equals Given equal screen time dialogues and actions But here I believe Hrithik is being pushed more than Saif and thats what bugs me,0.0,225
Ive just recently watched the original but Ive to say that this teaser actually looks really good Im not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but Ive high hopes from this film because its the same duo who directed the original one Personally I dont have any problems from a remake and I dont think remaking something is a crime The remake however has to be good If it doesnt justify the acting of the original actors then its a crime otherwise if its a remake like Kabir Singh which is a really good remake then I dont have any problems and I feel this remake will be genuinely good,2.0,637
I like how they made Hrithik a bit devilish instead of Vedha being the calm guy like in the original I feel like VJSs Vedha is how Mohanlal wouldve played Vedha and Hrithiks version is how Mammootty wouldve played the role,1.0,228

GuysIll ask again But may you please continue and go back to the bonus content and deleted scenes you missed Id really like to see you to react to them as they are IMPORTANT parts of bangtans world and connected to bangtans history shows how their emotions developed and changed over time and give further context to a specific era episode of the rise of bangtan I hope you dont just brush them aside as its really good imfomation to note as well as has all those behind the scenes you always like Not sure why that changed but I hope youll quickly return to them before it gets too far off Its a helpful smooth transition between episodes as well Because it gives you a mental break and as I said really just gives you more and more context and content As the series goes on theyll be more and more important to the series too Whether thats answering questions you may have had during the episode or clarifying something that couldnt be further explored in the episode itself Youve already missed so much content At the very least its be nice to have a reason why you stopped all of a sudden when its importance hasnt diminished but increased every episode,2.0,1188
Becoming ARMY truly is a lifechanging experience and one that anyone who hasnt done any of the work to look back at their history and discography can never understand I would have never thought that at the age of 54 I would become such a huge fan and supporter of the boyband my daughter had been a fan of for three years already at that point 2 years later almost to the day and I look back and shake my head in wonder at how much of an impact that 7 young men only slightly older than my daughter have had on me Because they have been utterly unwilling to listen to me or delve into the group themselves they have zero understanding and they all think Im crazy I think All I can think is how sad it is that they wont give them a chance and experience the same thing I have I like the reactors who become true fans and are open to the life change that happens when they open their minds and hearts to the beauty that is BTS You guys are that kind of reactor and its wonderful to see,2.0,1002
"Guys is there a chapter 22 or it ended at 21 
Jungkook is really hard working and perfectionist he want to go on stage matter what happens to him 
He is turning 25 very soon  he grew up ",2.0,186
Remember all the deleted and bonus episodes A chapter is not actually over until you watch them Maybe you didnt know I really like to watch you react to Rise of Bangtan but its beginning to seem a bit weird to me that you dont finish a chapter until moving on Your reactions always seems genuine but it has made me question wether you actually want to continue this series Its fair id you dont This is just so weird sorry,0.0,434

"Imagine this
You wake up in a room that youve never seen before The bed youre lying in is very comfortable You sink right into it You dont want to leave but you want to know where you are You sit up and looking around the room you see that it looks like youre in a very cozy but very old room This room has seen many many things it seems Theres a mirror to use in case the person staying in the room would like to fix themselves up to look nice There is a closet full of clothes however you see that there is already an outfit laid out for you If you prefer the feminine choice it is a beautiful seafoam green dress with a black and white striped bow and reaches just below your knees grouped with black mary janes and long white socks The masculine option is a suit that consists of the same colors in the most similar areas with black dress shoes You put on the outfit of choice and you leave the room You go down the stairs of the house to find two people They look like blonde twins One is a boy the other is a girl They are sipping their tea when one of them notices you 
Oh Youre awake The boy cries So they are The girl replies They introduce themselves as Aaron and Anastasia Aaron tells you that since youve been asleep all morning it would be good for you to go outside with them You reluctantly agree but all of your worries fly out the door when you step outside You see a field that looks like it was masterfully painted a nice mix pastel colors by the gods themselves There are mountains in the distance and you can also see a nice pond In the sky you can see the moons and even a planet or two You can even faintly see the stars There are trees by the pond and one of them has a pair of swings The three of you walk up to that tree and you spend the rest of the day playing there the twins took turns pushing you on the swing Eventually night came and you went back to the house for dinner Anastasia made the most delicious bread and pasta youd ever had and Aaron did the dishes insisting that you relax as their guest After a little while you retired to your bedroom changed into the clothes given to you and succumbed to a calm dreamers sleep wondering what the next day had in store for you",2.0,2288

"I remember two years ago staying up at 3 in the morning with a cup of anxiety just to listen to the 3 AM Study Session premiere at 144p using limited data on my half cracked phone wondering where Ill be in the future and if things will go well for me after I graduate

Now here I am once again at 3 in the morning with a cup of coffee fast internet and my own custom PC It took a lot to get here and I still have a long way to go in life and have uncertainties for my future But for anyone out there who have worries or anxieties for their next few years just know that if I could make it than so can you I hope you will get to experience the same bliss I have at the moment As we often forget to enjoy just today when we keep thinking about the tomorrows

And thank you ChilledCow for being there during the moments

Edit I just want to say I appreciate everyone for all the encouraging likes and messages I wish nothing but the best for all of you who are pulling through your struggles",0.0,1004

Hope this community lives forever

Amo tus mentiras me las comer
Pero no niegues al animal
Que cobra vida cuando estoy dentro de ti

I think baby elephants and lion cubs deserved an honorable mention,2.0,66
It was around the summer of 1974 when a friend and I went to the Fresno Zoo As we approached the hippo area we could see one in the water We watched it for a little while then started to walk away when suddenly this little baby hippo head broke the surface of the water Needless to say we were captivated by this tiny baby hippo that was frolicking in the water around its mother We could hardly tear our eyes away from the delightful sight Later that night  the local news show had a report about the new baby hippo that had just been born at the Zoo that day That baby hippo was one of the most adorable baby animals Ive ever seen,2.0,641
I couldnt stop smiling throughout the entire video and my heart just glowed with an aura of golden love Thank you so much for making our day brighter by showing all these adorable little darlings If I could Id adopt one of each I hope that we humans will                                                                                                                                                                                                  work together to save all these species and treat them with love I am so grateful that I was blessed with 7 kitties and one dog throughout my life they were truly a gift from God Many good wishes to you and all viewers,2.0,676

900 for those who dont knowthe giant megalodon is simply just a normal and harmless whale shark You can tell by the white spots covering its back and its round head Though I am a believer of Megs still existing its very clear from the gate way that this find isnt as rare or mega as they think,1.0,309
Also I think what you call shapeshifter is a newly discovered type of squid the lights are possible for a sea creature as we see deep water has lights well its no underwater electricity but its something,2.0,209
For the megalodon vs whale I think that the creature that just scooped up the whale it NOT a shark It doesnt seem like a normal attack of a shark,0.0,148
I wasnt there and Im not a marine biologist but the possible megalodon at 900 is clearly a whale shark,1.0,110
Pretty sure the Shape Shifter was a new species of deep sea Squid  There are various squids that have wedded tentacles such as the vampire squid Also the Ghost Squid is a Magnapinna Squid no doubts about it It doesnt any different from any Maganapinna Squid Ive ever seen Their nick name is Bigfin for a reason,1.0,322

"Lyrics

Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
Im afraid
Youre never satisfied

Here we go again
Were sick like animals
We play pretend
Youre just
A cannibal
And Im afraid
I wont get out alive
No I wont sleep tonight

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin in
Its getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide

I do it every time
Youre killin me now
And I wont be denied by you
The animal inside of you

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

Hush hush the world is quiet
Hush hush we both cant fight it
Its us that made this mess
Why cant you understand
Whoa I wont sleep tonight
I wont sleep tonight

Here we go again 3x

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting

Here we go again oh oh 3x
Say goodbye to my heart tonight

"In the animal kingdom the ability to hide disguise yourself blend in to your surroundings and be unseen not only affords you safety from predators but can also make you a deadly hunter In the African savannah Zebra graze on grasses they seemingly disappear into In the Madagascan jungles Chameleons change the color of their skin to suit the trees they climb In the warm tropics Mantis blend in amongst the foliage as they hunt their prey 

The Octopus becomes one with the great barrier reef with apparent supernatural ability Polar Bears and the Arctic Fox disappear in the blinding snow as they scour the arctic tundra Penguins play unseen by predators in Antarctica and the Snow Leopard rules the mountains of Southeast Asia

There is a big mistake in this The dazzle camouflage doesnt work to hide the zebra in the grass its designed to make it difficult to judge distance to a target So when the lion goes to attack the zebra he might pounce too soon and when he is in the chase he will find it difficult when to strike out with his claws The same thing was used against submarines,0.0,365

"A more cynical perspective on why public statefunded education became so popular and important for industrialized countries is because their workers now required more knowledge in order to be efficient They needed to be able to read and write and have basic numeracy skills to operate machines If the cost of teaching and training people was passed on to the state then companies would not have to spend money or time giving their workforce the tools they would be expected to use

Interesting My learning style is slow,2.0,40
My grade 8 science project back in the late 80s was on learning styles My teacher was shocked and surprised when I submitted my project idea All my subjects were my classmates Over a span of a couple weeks I tested their comprehension of certain short stories pictures and videos through visual audio and reading When the science fair day came my booth wasnt the most popular with any of the other kids but with all the school teachers and parents they loved it I remember the results of my project was inconclusive because I tested each student individually with each individual method of learning No one method of learning is better than another but combining multiple methods of learning is where results would be seen But I ran out of time to combine methods of learning before the project was due,2.0,824
I worked as a high school teacher for thirty years Over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory Learning style was just one of many Nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced Nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories presented as facts demanding evidence and proof Ever Yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher So you had no choice At least whilst being observed I became quite cynical in the end because I realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their CV And each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one God forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience education and intelligence,0.0,978

Im a teacher in New Zealand and VARK was covered in my teaching degree 17 years ago We did questionaires to determine the order of our preferences but we were told to try and cover all these aspects in our teaching ie try and give the children a verbal aspect and an auditory aspect and a reading aspect and a kinaesthetic aspect That sounds more like the multimodal approach you described I remember I came home very excited about it and suggested to my wife that she do the questionnaire as well She looked at it and said I dont want to read all that cant you read it to me,2.0,592

"As someone who grew up doing Common Core

It just took time away from learning things that were actually useful in class it frustrated the teachers attempting to teach it and it cost the school a lot of money to get all the printed math books and other Common Core materials for essentially no benefit to the students

"Apologies for not watching the whole video  As a former student and a parent of students I know the system was broken long before common core  I remember in college my English 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide because I was so deficient on the basicsthough I did well in English all through school  I had to take remedial math because my high school didnt prepare me for college coursesthough I graduated with the required credits  

Things have gone down since I was a student and my kids had schools with very high standards but very low expectations  That means there were a lot of advanced classes offeredlike calculusbut so many ways to accept failure  They had to take history and social studies but only had to PASS one  The policy of No Child Left Behind was an additional failure as it meant no one failed or was held back even though they wouldnt graduate on time  Kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted  

Too much government involvement means teachers arent allowed to TEACH  We have some phenomenal teachers who are underpaid with far too much nonteaching responsibility heaped on them  Schools arent just expected to educate students  Now theyve got to feed them clothe them teach them manners and how to get along look out for abuse deal with all their special needs and accompanying IEPs head off bullying deal with allergies and medical conditions worry about gender identity and sexuality discipline fairly deal with helicopter parents check the boxes for college prep and deal with the everpresent worry over school shootings  

With all were expecting from schools and teachers its a wonder anyone goes into this profession or stays once they see the outlook  

Common core like No Child Left Behind is a great idea on paper that fails in implementation  My kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were welleducated  There was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students  It meant even more testing for studentsto judge whether their teachers were up to the task  At the same time they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do betterlike tenure  They promoted the best teachers out of the classroom  They took away teaching assistants due to the costs  They increased class sizes  And they started charter schoolswhich were experimental programs  

Imagine if all those billions spent on common core were used to pay teachers moreand get out of their way",0.0,2641

"Thanks well done Sprouts and the visuals are just amazing Deweys theory is certainly viable if there is proper funding for Education It It is  therefore easier to implement in a private school setting as compared to a public school one A critic would be how possible is it to find enough time within the term to implement the learning by doing eg planting and watching plants grow while at the same time covering the required syllabus For the discussions it is important that some teacher  instructions and prior reading and research happens before for the discussiondebate to be meaningful enough to sprout out new perspectives and ideas

"    these are some most important and  precious advices every one should read  

1 Take risks in your life If you win you can lead if you lose you can guide

2 People are not what they say but what they do so judge them not from their words but from their actions

3 When someone hurts you dont feel bad because its a law of nature that the tree that bears the sweetest fruits gets maximum number of stones

4 Take whatever you can from your life because when life starts taking from you it takes even your last breath

5 In this world people will always throw stones on the path of your success It depends on what you make from them  a wall or a bridge

6 Challenges make life interesting overcoming them make life meaningful

7 There is no joy in victory without running the risk of defeat

8 A path without obstacles leads nowhere

9 Past is a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay

10 You cant have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time

11 If what you did yesterday still looks big to you then you havent done much today

12 If you dont build your dreams someone else will hire you to build theirs

13 If you dont climb the mountain you cant view the plain

14 Dont leave it idle  use your brain

15 You are not paid for having brain you are only rewarded for using it intelligently

16 It is not what you dont have that limits you it is what you have but dont know how to use

17 What you fail to learn might teach you a lesson

18 The difference between a corrupt person and an honest person is The corrupt person has a price while the honest person has a value

19 If you succeed in cheating someone dont think that the person is a fool Realize that the person trusted you much more than you deserved

"Im from India and here students can get admission to all the big universities only through an entrance exam Due to covid the exams were postponed in April which is the usual time they happen Now when the country has hit peak infection the Central Government has decided to hold all the exams At least 30 million students attempt these exams each year Despite the clamour from the students and Opposition the Government is proceeding with it Students have a long list of various concerns that are brushed aside

1 Due to the rains many regions are flooded families displaced and property destroyed

2 Transportation is nearly impossible Some States have still not lifted the lockdown so trains buses and taxis are either unavailable or charge exorbitant rates

3 The Exam Centres are few and far between particularly in the rural areas Without means of transportation students are unable to reach the exam centres Even if they do manage to arrange for transport as hotels and restaurants are closed or open only for takeout they cannot find safe accomodation

4 Many of the students have applied to multiple universities offering same or similar programs They all have entrance exams in September If a student tests positive due to any of these exams either he cannot take the exam or he infects hundreds of others when he attempts the paper despite the illness 

And like always the poor and disadvantaged in the country are suffering the most in this situation

The government has offered no explanation or assurances for safety This is a no win situation for both students and their families  The government has no solution that affects millions of students education and career other than to postpone the exam or hold the exam This is the state of education in India right now due to an incompetent government",1.0,1853

"Ive been an edtech consultant in Beijing for 7 years Ive also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools There are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive

The first and foremost factor I would note is the lack of public discourse This permeates through every part of society especially education If you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner inquiry and reflection In education this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge Even in history class theres no critical thinking or reflection involved it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember 

The second factor of note is barriers of information The public does not have easy access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content and even if they did get access they wouldnt be able to recognize it On top of that there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as VIPKids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations This causes market distortion and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name EG Wonders and say thats their curriculum without any plan how to implement it

The third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge As stated in the first point most of the populations education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection If youve been taught not to question things your whole life how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies  How can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences The result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good or fishing consultants like me for free content

The fourth factor is lack of foreign talent There are not enough QUALIFIED teachers to meet demand The general population would not be able to recognize one either Many companies hire Russians call them American and slap a 200 markup on the course Its up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content instruction and meet the unrealistic expectations the decision makers sales people set for the parents

The final factor is who the decision makers are Who decides what national curriculum is Starting in 2020 private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the national curriculum This topdown decision making only exasperates the situation It also permeates throughout the society Ive been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools  Most of these decision makers are unqualified theyre sales people at best
I should also mention that many parents have no clue about education yet influence the schools with their misconceptionsbut this is not the parents fault Rather its the schools fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program

As for price its simply about demand vs supply  Lack of foreign talent as mentioned before combined with a desperate middle class and higher trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost They will pay upwards of 200k RMB just to make it happen for their little Middle Schooler

Unfortunately I exited the market partially because the clients I had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problemsmostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum",0.0,3672
"My sons were in Chinese public schools until 8th and 9th grade respectively  I am French and their mom and Chinese so we thought it was important they at least attended a few years of school in the local system  Until the 6th grade the system does work and teaches them importance of hard work  now as bicultural kids they were actually considered foreigners which in a way lessened academic pressure but also caused resentment especially for my older son  From 6th grade onwards the pressure becomes pointless and is made worse because teachers and schools are incentivized on class results  the worst of them will not hesitate to try and persuade weaker students to leave  Bullying by teachers can also occur  my youngest son went all the way to the zhongkao and got accepted into a top local high school but then asked if he could go to an international school  he went to a very selective one but probably has only half the workload of his former classmates

This 2021 reform only focused on alleviating some financial burden  what it didnt do is address some fundamental issues with the system

 Teachers are not incentivized to help weaker students  instead they push them out
 Everything is based on 2 tests  one in grade 9 and one in grade 12  These tests are extremely hard but also very narrow and focus on rote learning but do not do enough to help kids develop analytical skills even if that has improved a bit  system should be reformed to take equivalent of GPA into account  this would ease a lot of the pressure
 The last 5 years of high school are spent on passing 2 exams rather than help students grow

There is a little that is learnt in those 5 years to help them transition to higher education  Yes most of them will have strong language and math skills  But a lot of it is mechanical  Some families were using tutors to develop the analytical side of things so at least the ministry should also have reformed part of the curriculum",1.0,1984

"The problem I have with those overly stressful education systems is that I wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them What I learned through selfdefense practice and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus and are not an effective way to learn In selfdefense instructors increase stress by making you do cardiobased exercises to make your body artificially feel stress accelerated heartbeat difficulty to breath difficulty to focus only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal but they dont do it for learning purposes The military seems to do it too in their own way
I would also point out that every doctor in the world with common sense would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue

"I found this very interesting and as someone with ADHDI I had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it

It brought up so many points of interest With in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution ADHD is considered an epidemic of our time and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking From the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses As time went on this idea continued but in a different way By the 1920s there was a drive towards raising the standards of living People were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked and live in the suburbs in a house get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style

But like he said in the talk this type of trend doesnt work anymore Styles of life are so divergent and its obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women arent going to be stay at home moms and many cant Actually during the 60s many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life And as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living

As for ADHD it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child I believe ADHD is both a cause and symptom of behavior but not always both Take your eyes for example You get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly so you get prescription lenses You now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription And no one asks why

No one asks why are you like this how did it happen Or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it Yes and no You can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met Becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors Your nutrition your genetics and your life style Actually  some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight by changing their diet and their habits For instance a child who stays inside all day watching TV and playing videogames for hours refuses to eat his vegetables and whos parents or relatives have had glasses may develope near sightedness

So in relation a child who has been mentally watching TV and playing videogames all day not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity exploring their real world developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating interacting socially with others around them making constant decisions based on logic real feelings and experiences and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner And it doesnt just go for ADHD This could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty In varying degrees of course But it is believed that behavior in any form is partially learned and partially developed And by developed I mean the way your brain developed How your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works

Going back to education you can see why this factory mind set cant work for everyone As well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts you find contradiction Most people dont understand the arts Most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesnt make sense anymore Truth is that area of education evolved but only by those who pursue it would understand A big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world The A grade is the pinacle of that idea  Do perfectly in your education and you get an A 

Well this doesnt really work in the art world You still get graded when you do your work and do it well but school is for practicing the academics In art you study academics as well like art history art Theory and your use of a medium like drawing or painting What you dont get graded on is on the things that cant be measured like your idea your creativity and the value of your work Though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill But when it comes right down to it art isnt about any of this or it can be about all of it It can be about how others value your work it can be about how divergent your work seems to be it can be about how well your work matches a subject it can be about how well you use methods of design it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic AKA art competition or auction So in a way it is chaotic to the point people cant make sense of it any more but it is not inherently measurable and perfected

It is the product of ideas And ideas are valued above all else And yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty",2.0,5615

"As a millenial I cant help feeling like we were the experiemental group with university somehow How much could colleges charge and get away with How far can they upsell this idea of helping people get better jobs by going in debt for the rest of their lives Its ridiculous that celebrating paying off student loans is even a thing in the first place 

Now that the next gen has seen the effects they are only taking logical next steps to ensure their own security Universities is just way too expensiveon top of that theres cost of housing and food and transportation If it were more affordable I truly believe more kids absolutely would go

 BUT if someone in that position asked me for advice I would always advise them to at least complete community college and 2 year degrees or certification programs at the very least in a practical field Many include internships that have great potential to lead to decent jobs",0.0,934
I find this so awesome I hope these colleges are FORCED to significantly drop their prices They sucked American students dry Crippled an entire generation of millennials from being homeowners and ever building financial security Now its finally coming to a head and its long overdue I hope students find great jobs and stay out of debt,2.0,343
I started my career in the food industry as a shelf stocker at a grocery store Then was promoted to Merchandiser then to a Buyer A vendor later asked me to join them doing sales Fast forward to today Im 36 still doing sales but now in the seafood industry and make about 150k gross annually Not bad for someone that didnt go to college Find what youre good at and work hard at it College isnt for everyone,2.0,419
"This was inevitable  University tuition kept skyrocketing over the past 20 years Tuition has greatly outpaced both inflation and incomes for collegeaged students 

The entire Millennial generation became de facto indentured servants from their college debt Basically financial slaves to their debt

Education can be very useful for employment goals but there are limits And we are approaching that limit from a cost to value perspective

Generation Z is not stupid and they are declining to voluntarily set themselves up for a lifetime of paying back student debt Trust me Gen Z  you do not want to find yourself in that situation It will steal years if not decades from your life And you will never get that time back 

Also most skills of the high demand and lucrative software engineering tech jobs are not taught in college but rather can be learned just as easily by anyone with a cheap internet connection and sufficient motovationfocus 

Its common for software developers to earn 6 figure salaries with no college at all  Companies do not care where you went to school or even of you went they only care if you have the skills that can help solve their business problems  How you go about acquiring those skills is totally irrelevant The company doesnt care if you learned to program Java at college or on your own

Its high time that universities start to feel the sting to their annual profits as more 17 and 18 year olds wake up and push back on the cost of attending college",1.0,1517
They are smart to opt out Ive been going to school my entire life Im 48 and enjoy learning There is no difference between high school and community colleges There is also no guarantee you will find work with a degree Just because you have a degree doesnt mean your work is good Professors will rarely tell you if your portfolio is good because they dont care The institution they work for already have their money Technical colleges used to be different but they too are falling into the hands of CEO executives who think they know how to run a college Colleges also dont let teachers teach The price of education is NOT worth it You get a better education from the University of Youtube which most teachers use to teach,1.0,738

If you allow young people to be inquisitive creative and selfreliant they will educate themselves throughout their adult lives Childhood should be seen as a sacred phase of development and education as a means of the individual to empower themselves as and when they choose to not a punishment to be inflicted upon the unwilling until they are ready to enter the ranks of workers bureaucrats and managers,1.0,412

Russel Brand did a really good job here   He made the interview light and enjoyable and at the same time probed Yuval to go deeper into his ideas than Ive seen him go in other interviews,2.0,190
It seems to me that the purpose of life is to contribute to Society and do good things And the purpose of education is to learn how to interpret and understand the World Students need to learn the language of the World They need a good solid understanding of the basics Then they can adapt to anything and be better prepared to contribute,2.0,349

Great discussion Thank you Yuval said early in his talk that we should look to our governments to ensure that the youth of today receive the kind of education they need to survive in the future I would suggest that national politicians are likely to be the future useless people My government in Africa has done nothing to help the people All it has done is line the pockets of the politicians Education is already being reengineered today by the private sector  Udacity Coursera come to mind There are huge changes taking place through these and other similar organisations and their association with universities around the world So the future of the youth of today depends on THEM Thomas Friedman in his book Thank You for Being Late suggests that the previous digital divide between the educated and the lesser educated has gone and the new divide is the Motivational Divide The youth of today need to be intrinsically motivated and overcome the natural laziness that Yuval tells us about and learn and keep learning What they need to know is WHAT to learn then learn it with the help of the Internet organisations like Udacity Khan Academy Coursera and coaches and mentors teachers in the world of yesterday Schools also need to embrace these changes,1.0,1288

India is a country of a billion people but if anyone ever says that stuff again ask them what is the addressable market for their product and watch the fun Ill bet my money 99 of these so called entrepreneurs dont know how big their market actually is thats why they can never convert their company into conglomerates,0.0,329

"Masters Union cannot replace institutions like IIM or IIT because of the sheer fact that MU does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university Indian colleges or Universities dont have any place in the top institutes of the world and rightly so but something that an IIT or IIM has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy
Because of the implementation of reservation there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into IIMs and IITs be lacking in certain core subjects Dont assume I am a casteist because I am outlining a drawback in reservation policy I completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who havent had access to great education in their schoolscolleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education But in an institution like Masters Union going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds who have had access to great education since kindergarten While Masters union assures great education institutions like IITs and IIMs ensure social equity and great education
The entire para is based on my knowledge that there are no reservations in MU",0.0,1613

"I D E A for new civilization experiment
Nations are split on the big continent and a small lake isle in the center of continent
The nations are Plains boost to farming and gathering resources get more of them  they have additional heart in ther region but they have 1 heart in other regions so making a nation to defend rather then attack Structures Castle and village next to it
Jungle Jump higher and get much lower fall damage can build special sorts of bases I guess but 1 heart overall Structures Aztec Temple and village on trees
Desert Loses less hunger bars over time
 other nations in their region lose 1 heart but the desert people lose 1 heart in other regions like the Plains Structures A pyramid and a trading post
Swamp Their potions are more effective and lasting  they dont need to kill blazes to make potions but they have 1 heart in THEIR region Structures Giant witch hut
Islanders live on their own island  Faster swimming on boats and themselves better fishing efficiency but the isle is little and not much land is fertile that makes them invade others Structures Seaport  Dock and Coastal village 
Snow It is very cold there and people are brutal They are 2 heart s in the beginning but for every kill they get 1 heart that makes them an aggressive unstable society but they can eat only meat because they probably have never seen vegetables Structures igloo village plus Viking fort
Mountains Quick diggers 15x speed
Structures Forgotten mine  dvarvish fortress
The situation of the regions 
               Snow                  Mountains

Question is there a specific reason why you recommend taking the SAT twice I heard a lot that getting a 1500 or above is a mark that for example colleges dont look too deeply into whether you got a 1500 or 1540 Not too big of a deal So if I were to get a 1500 the first time should I really take it again,1.0,314

"Notes
All the information youll need will be on the test whether its in the passage or the little introduction brief
Before reading the passage skim the questions to see if therere any summarytheme questions and take note of the vocab words
Remember to read the titlelittle introduction
For vocab questions read the whole sentence plus maybe the sentences before and after for context Then substitute in each answer
Know what certain terms are 704

For twopart questions
Look at the second part and highlight all the quotes in the passage
Then read the first question only the question and try to see which quote answers every part of the question
Compare the quote to the first questions answers

For the literature passage
Try to be engagedto have fun
Read challenging books beforehand

For the debate passages
Read the first passage and answer all the passage1specific questions while its still fresh in your mind
Repeat for passage 2

Especially for the Sciencebased passages dont infer anything Use the passagegraphs to back up each answer",1.0,1088

Thanks for sharing I am really glad you put this video in the context of what schools the student is looking to apply to since SAT scores are all relative Since I score a 1500 it blows my mind to think about being in the top 99 I think the part about scores being inflated because schools dont have to report bad test scores since students arent submitting bad tests scores makes sense However I do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the US World News Report requires a school to report at least 50 of its students scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings Thus more elite schools will take more students with scores than without to maintain their coveted spots,2.0,747
Hi Brooke Ive been watching your videos for a while and was able to score a 1560 as a junior My subscores are both 780 which is causing me a dilemma because I want to go into engineeringCS My total score is at the 75th percentile or higher for almost every school Im applying to but my math is at the lower end for my intended major some places Should I retake to get a 790 or 800 or will it not make much difference,1.0,426
Hey Brooke would a 1520 superscored SAT made from a 1490 780M  710E and a 1450 710M  740E be looked down upon by schools that have 1520 right at the bottom of the middle 50 Would raw 1520 be a considerable improvement,1.0,228

First of all let me clear up the misunderstanding about why Asians do well in life we do not always send kids off to academic supplements SAT study classes etc Obviously there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go but there are a plethora that do just as well if not better on these types of activities SAT ACT GPA school etc without any additional help aside from a practise test book from the local library That is me and I can affirm that for many Asian kids we have an inherent need to do good make our parents proud no matter how much pressure we have and have a highlevel job and go to Ivy League schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us We push for the best because of our work ethic not because all Asians have oh so much money For the majority of our parents as immigrants it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour the hard work the exhaustion and the prejudice they have faced in the past all to provide their children with more opportunities It is not that Asians are inherently smarter or richer or more privileged in any ways although there are those select few but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today Asians are no different from others of ethnic origin to say Mexicans AfricanAmericans Indians and other disprivileged minorities in the States The only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties Do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end I am not trying to start up any racial slurs cursing or insultations of any kind just putting out a thought and consideration for you all Obviously there are many successful talented and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones but I am just making a point here Why would the highlevel universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of racial preference or racial advantage Note I put that in quotations meaning I myself do not think that is a fact There are hardworking and lazy people smart and ignorant good and bad in any race it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public So tell me why should one race get more sympathy or preference over another Can we not just all be equal human beings It is like saying red is better than pink Why Oh because it is true without an explanation So what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade Chinese girl and I wanted to share the truth to everyone Thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully we can all start changing society little by little with messages like this No enmities I hope ,2.0,2937

"My predictions will edit after I get results

Readingwriting 710740
Math 790800
Overall 15001540

Edit 1 a few hours after taking the test Feel really confident about the math section reading was way easier than usual and writing had a bunch of easy questions but had a few that I couldnt figure out the differences parts of sentence replacement not grammar

Edit 2 12 months after taking the test yea I forgot about where I left this comment Anyways I took two SATs march 2nd school day and march 12th

2nd rw 750 math 790 overall 1540
12th rw 760 math 800 overall 1560
superscore the same as 12th

honestly surprised with readingwriting especially the reading section I missed 1 reading on the 2nd but that was 40 subsection so didnt matter and 4 on the 12th 5 writing on 2nd and 1 on writing

Math I missed 1 question due to not reading carefully and 1 because I didnt know how to do it on the 2nd but perfect score on the 12th

if I got the reading section of the 2nd and the writing section of the 12th on the same day I could have a score of 1590

definitely not taking the SAT again",2.0,1139

"Thank you for the info 
Im a Brazilian student struggling if its worth applying to the US 
I did a indepth research some mock sats at home and have a strong sympathy for certain American colleges education structure as compared to Brazilian or European universities which Im fortunate to have the citizenship in both places Nevertheless if I do decide to take this time to apply and commit to this dream that has grown on me in the past few years Id have to eliminate one of my options whether USP in Brazil or EPFL in Switzerland due to the amount of time set into both 
While balancing my studies for the local admissions testFuvestUSP the EPFLs entrance exams in French and a few ECs I obtained a couple of 1550 scores at home following all the procedures as timemonitored tests I judge my English as nearfluent since I have been taking classes since I was 9 Above all I have a strong passion for physics mathematics and technologiesmainly AI related to physics research
I also would be prone to take SAT II and possibly AP exams as well as the TOEFL to sum up with my 96 out of 10 GPA
My main concern involves my financial background and my lack of extracurriculars related to my major of interest  math or physics with computer science
I have participated weekly in two educational NFOs since I was in middle school and more recently online with administrative work some calls and at the end of the pandemic as a teacher which I loved I had acoustic guitar lessons in the same period mentioned until I started piano lessons one year ago I have been taking English and French private lessons for 4 years and played varsity statelevel soccer being the captain until the pandemic started I acknowledge and feel this excitement for applied maths and physics pushing me to possibly pursue a career in academia and live I life I wont regret however I awfully believe that my extracurriculars arent good enough for top 20 schools and Im inclined to study in epfl where id have an amazing education but entirely different from what Ive expected as the holistic formation to some eclectic interests that I also have in history and art 
Back to my financial means Im entirely grateful for the opportunities that I already have and a possible new pursuit would be limited to an investment of 25000 per year from my parents By converting my mothers income to USD35000 we would qualify for 100 financial support from needbased universities and those would be my goals
My question is am I a strong applicant for Americas A1 universities undergrad or have I lost my chance by not investing in a passion project",2.0,2679

"Truly inspiring video The presentation is truly flawless and the few frames of Minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game I love how you used pocket edition because its unique and different than most Minecraft videos being published today using PC or console versions of the game and I really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out Also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles I really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them Also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding If you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay we can find that the player is holding a torch just like the many around his shelter This means the torches around the base has just been placed and shows how you can move forward in life no matter how dire the situation may seem In the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what Also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning showing how even if someone is in their home they are never safe of the dangers outside and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety I also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls Not to mention the way the player looks out the exit as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there and how even though you may be small compared to the universe the impact you make can change the world Another very symbolic part of this film is the ending where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the players dedication It also is in a slightly smaller frame and black bars replace the outer edges which show that even though you try your best there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey and how much different it could have been if you have done something different which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of Minecraft as long as possible without itching ones testicles The background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt blue or sad about ending but still proud of what they accomplished and is hopeful for what is to come

A really poetic performance really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls I cant wait to see more work from you

When I was in elementary school back in the 70s I was reading my way through my schools scifi section It was just a few shelves but it had almost all the classics Asimov Bova Bradbury Campbell Clarke Doc Smith Heinlein  and then I got to Verne Id just finished up 30000 Leagues and was getting into Journey to the Center of the Earth when I found a page had been ripped from the book

Being a good student I reported it to the Librarian but instead of focusing on the missing page she was outraged that I was reading this particular book It was above my level she said and too difficult for me This was a hundredyearold story at this point and I was pretty sure it wasnt a difficult one to follow  the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on Creature Feature on Saturdays But she still took the book away and over the next few weeks that scifi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there

A short time later I overheard her talking to another teacher about of all things a shooting star  a meteor that many had seen a night or two before The Librarian was mocking the teacher because a shooting star is impossible  the Heavens are permanent The stars dont move As the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor it seemed to both terrify and outrage her And the longer that conversation went on the more even I maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time realized  the scifi books she had removed werent above MY level they were above HER level She had no understanding of science and all these scifi stories about starships robots and alien worlds were things that she just didnt understand and because of that they scared her so she locked them away

My favorite creature ever  I was on a crab ship in Russia  I was the green horn so I had to empty out the pots  I was also making hooch quietly because it was forbidden it was lighting in a cup so I could swap liquor with the chef for him making me private meals  One day there was an octopus in a crab pot  I tossed it a live well Came back once everyone was off the deck  Was gonna take it to the chef it softly wrapped itself around my arm and I felt like I could see the fear in its eyes  I couldnt do it  I took it over to the side of the ship held it over  It looked down looked back at me let go of my arm and worked its way down the side of the ship until it got to the water  AMAZING CREATURES,2.0,722
"I think cephalopod intelligence is hard wired An octopus has a very short lifespan as little as 18 months and has to learn everything from the moment it hatches completely on its own

Its mother died before it emerged from the egg so it is born an orphan This has huge implications because despite being intelligent it has no mentor to learn from

Its also a mollusk so in a way its a slug with awesome superpowers

Theyre fascinating animals",1.0,460
I can genuinely say I have never been more astounded by another being on this planet  The evolution of this beautiful creature is literally out of this world  This video left such an imprint on me that being able to pet play handle or be in close graces of this animal are on my lifes bucketlist for sure  Being apart of research and doing a 180 degree career change may be in my future,2.0,396

One of the most amazing species of Octopus is the Mimic Octopus it not only uses its shape changing skin and camouflage to hide but also imitates other sea life both as a way to escape predators when being chased by a damselfish itll make itself look like a banded sea snake which is a damsel fish predator but also to hunt imitating a crab to draw in another crab The list of animals its been observed to imitate is quite long Jelly Fish Lionfish Sea Snakes Zebra Sole Flatfish Giant Crab Sea Horses ect it has also been recorded imitating at least two species we dont know about the same shape were recorded in separate locations being used by different individuals,2.0,689
I feel that this is a great place to recommend the book Children of Ruin  it depicts a society of octopuses that were subject to a virus which causes accelerated evolution and the struggle of humans to communicate with them Some of the best scifi Ive read,2.0,260

I just want to say that I absolutely love this Im both mindblown entertained and inspired As a mere psych student I still feel like I understood a whole lot of it and they even made some psych references And the way they talked about children having an intuitive understanding of quantum stuff made me think of theorytheory and this quote Its not that children are little scientists  its that scientists are big children,2.0,435
This was a phenomenally moderated session Serious kudos to John,2.0,65
I am very thankful for this presentation I was afraid I was the only one that was pondering these ideas specifically concerning microbiology Specifically the ability of bacterium changing their polarity quickly through chemical absorption of charged ions that are easily available through their outer cell wall causing that microbe to move in a since chemically That would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light In effect just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving its structure idle at its point of origin but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parents original quality In this accomplishing the  quantum speeds Said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction as well as color change We see this in octopus or the movement of photophilic  plant cells Great  discussion,2.0,949

Take note At 5200 the assertion is made that cellular biology especially how DNA directs construction of its copy during mitosis is incredibly complex This should answer my critics who say Im overstating the facts when I refer to DNA as a 4D molecule It functions like a computer program or at least like a program controller within a cell,1.0,351

"I use to be in the army I can remember in training the endless patrols through the woods
But the dragonflies were our friends Youd see them gliding back and forth just over our heads catching the mosquitoes which swarmed around us 
It was impossible for the dragonflies to get all the mosquitoes but it was a comfort to know we had allies out there in those woods",2.0,372
I once was kayaking with my father in Florida when I took a break from rowing a beautiful dragonfly landed on the end of my ore About 12 seconds of me gawking at it went by before a bigger dragonfly landed on top of the first and proceeded to quickly rip its head off After it decapitated my new found friend it took off with the body leaving the head sitting on my ore with my jaw on the floor in total shock of what murder I had just witnessed That day I learned that Dragon flies are metal as fuck,0.0,504

Thank you so much for sharing the wonderful fact about them",2.0,351
Ive seen a dragon fly with 6 wings once I was floating down a river and it was flying near me and then landed on me for a short time All of the wings worked A cool mutation I wonder how rare it is Wish I had a camera with me,2.0,230
What intelligence to be able to skillfully control those beautiful wings About 22 years ago my husband and I stopped by a large creek to meditate As I opened my eyes a group of five dragonflies that were traveling over the water suddenly stopped in front of my face hovered there for about 10 seconds then suddenly did a 90 degree turn in synchronized fashion and continued on their way down the creek It was otherworldly Ill never forget it Thank you for this excellent content,2.0,489

You mentioned that bioinformatics is the field that uses computers to analyze genetic data when statistical methods arent enough but when statistical methods are enough that is a field called quantitative genetics And using it we can often tell whether a trait is genetic without having to know which specific genes are involved It can also help give candidates for molecular genetic study to find the genes relating to those traits,1.0,438
"These videos are good but I have two minor criticisms of this one

1 Structural biology is concerned with the structure of large macromolecules Amino acids are all small molecules so they fall more under the purview of biochemistry Your description is almost verbatim one of the sentences from the opening paragraph of the Wikipedia page on structural biology but I dont think thats correct

2 Biomedical engineering is the field that makes artificial organs and other medical devices Biotechnology uses living organisms or their products for our purposes Synthetic biology creates synthetic organisms and is closely related to biotechnology but the latter two fields arent closely related to the first",0.0,716

It wasnt until years later that I found out that orcas are actually fearsome beasts that sat at the top of the oceans food chain

One of the coolest things to me about orcas that the video doesnt mention is that there has never been a recorded human death from a wild orca But orcas have been recorded and seen leading humans towards pods of whales to hunt They might see humans as a potential symbiotic relationship since theyre known to eat human leftovers from whaling or snag stray fish when fishermen use nets Just super cool that they easily could attack and kill humans but seemingly have no interest in doing so,2.0,494
"The Lummi Nation refer to the local orcas as Qwe lhol mechen which means our relatives who live under the sea or the people under the waves Orcas live in tightknit families In most cases both males and females stay in their natal pod throughout their entire lives this is especially true for Southern and Northern Residents Orcas are incredibly intelligent and social Their limbic system the part of the brain that processes emotion is incredibly developed and complex Each pod uses a distinctive dialect to communicate Theyre the only species besides humans pilot whales beluga whales and narwhals that go through menopause

I remember watching Black Fish and hearing one of the sailors sent to capture the first set of Orca calves remark about how when getting the calves in the boats the vocalizations they heard made them realize they were taking a baby and that its family was crying because of it Really unnerving information for a college student aiming to become a scientist,0.0,357

"Expand to see important notes for this video 1 This video as stated in the description focuses on general functions of biomolecules The biomolecules carbs lipids proteins and nucleic acids can all can have important functions in the body  This is a video about the general function of biomolecules For your dietary needs consult with a dietitian or medical doctor  2 We mention the popular CHO CHO CHON CHONP mnemonic for major elements in the biomolecules As we mention these are basics There can be more elements such as sulfur for example in proteins but we wanted to identify common elements starting at the building block level  At the building block level some amino acids lack sulfur for example Its not just sulfur For example there are lipids that can additionally contain phosphate or nitrogen The popular CHO CHO CHON CHONP mnemonic sticks with basic elements found even at the building block level 3 Since this video only uses one character for carbohydrates one character for lipids and one character for proteins  unfortunately when mentioning general functions of each biomolecule type it isnt designed to show a specific type We received a great point in an email though that since our little lipid character is a triglyceride this can be confusing when naming lipid functions For example at 352 in the video when saying lipids are part of the cell membrane it would be much better if we do not show the little lipid character so there wont be any confusion as we do not want to imply that specific lipid type makes up the cell membrane Phospholipids are a major lipid type in the cell membrane although other types exist as well We plan to explore creating individual detailed videos on lipids carbs and proteins where we can show different types

Theres a lot more unusual stuff under the hood of these guys and their Echidna cousins Their skeletons for example have epipubic bones aka pouch bones which are only found in Marsupials and Monotremes But more unusual still they have 3 bones in their pectoral girdle while ALL other mammals have only two On a human for example the pectoral girdle aka the bones that link the arms to the rest of the skeleton and make up the shoulder is made of two bones the scapula shoulder blade and Clavicle collar bone with one running to the back and the other linking up at a socket in the sternum It means that we like all mammals can pivot our shoulders around not just the arms within the socket Compare this to birdsreptiles and older Tetrapod groups and youll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum This third bone is the Coracoid bone and mammals lost it a long time ago except in Monotremes On the plus though like the rigid flight frame of a bird it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why Platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim or echidna to dig Splayed legs more ribs than other mammals low body heat  eggs venom etc honestly make platypus and echidna more like lizards in a furry costume than just a beaver with a duck bill or a pointynosed hedgehog,1.0,1459

There were several things that were not taken into account when evolving over time  They stuck way too closely to frog morphology and tried to hammerfit it into each of the niches  Amphibians have varied morphology now that were advantageous for land dwelling amphibians but were not mentioned    Amphibians that become completely terrestrial without need for water as part of their life cycle no longer meet the definition of amphibian  Every evolved amphibian retained frog eyes and body structure  Evolution is also influenced by things never mentioned as well  Predator prey relationships drive evolution  Fast running prey animals and predictors are an example  Size also dictates evolution due to environmental factors  Amphibians respiratory system is a limiting factor as many dont have lungs and breathe by uptake of oxygen through the skin or primitive lungs  This limits size  The larger the animal the more oxygen is needed  Thats why lungs evolved  This would also change mouth and nose shape,1.0,1024

Along with that here is what I quickly typed down as a sort of SUMMARY feel free to fix

 William Prout discovered our stomachs have hydrochloric acid and discovered chemical composition of urea Also discovered food is divided into carbs fats and proteins

 Carbohydrates are the source of all energy 

 Carbs are made of sugars with the simplest being monosaccharides

 Glucose a monosaccharide number 1 sugar that comes from the sun

 Fructose same chemical as glucose but arranged differently and is sweeter

 Disaccharides are two monosaccharides put together

 Sucrose fructose and glucose connected is a disaccharide joined by a covalent bond

 Polysaccharides are thousands of simple sugar units

 Cellulose is a bunch of glucose molecules

 Bread is made of starch and amylase

 Our bodies store carbs in form of glycogen in our muscle until we need to use them

 We store our energy long term through fat aka lipids

 Lipids are non polar and cant dissolve in water

 Fats are made of glycerol and fatty acids

 Saturated fats dont have double bonds while unsaturated fats do

 Trans fat do not exist in nature and are unsaturated and bad for the body

 Omega 3 fats unsaturated are essential but we need to eat them in order to get them

 Phospholipids form cell membrane walls to keep bad stuff out and good stuff in

 Phospholipids are one end polar and one end non polar

 Steroids a phospholipid made of 4 carbon rings are used to make cholesterol

 Proteins of made of 20 amino acids which do everything for the body

 Nitrogen can only be gotten into our bodies from food via foods high in protein

 Polypeptides are formed by long chains of amino acids

 The 9 essential amino acids which are bodies cant make on their own are histidine isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine threonine tryptophan and valine",1.0,1959

"Since the animations are kinda confusing the numbers up I recapped the transformation here

Glycolysis

Glucose  2 ATP  2 Pyruvates  Energy
This energy is used for making 4 ATP net profit of 2 ATP and 2 NADH from 2 ADP 2 NAD and 2 hydrogen probably H

Fermentation

Pyruvate  Energy  Lactic Acid

Krebs Cycle

2 Pyruvates  2 O  2 Acetyl Coenzyme A  2 CO  Energy
This energy is used to form 2 NADH from NAD and hydrogen
2 Acetyl Coenzyme A  2 Oxaloacetic Acid  2 Citric Acid
2 Citric Acid  4 O  2 Oxaloacetic Acid  Energy  4 CO
This energy is used to make 2 ATP 6 NADH and 2 FADH
So after the Krebs Cycle we now have 10 NADH 2 FADH and 4 ATP or 6 if you count the ATP spent in Glycolysis

Electron Transport Chain

10 NADH  Energy  10 NAD  10 Hydrogen
This energy is used to pump some protons out of the inner membrane of the mitochondria They went back through the ATP synthase creating at most 3 ATP for each NADH for a total of 30 ATP at most
2 FADH  Energy  2 FAD  4 Hydrogen
This energy is also used to pump some protons This creates at most 2 ATP each FADH for a total of 4 ATP

Conclusion
Total ATP created 38 molecules if the cell is very efficient
2 ATP is spent in glycolysis so there would be at most 40 ATP that went through the steps
10 NAD were used and probably reused
2 FAD were used and also probably reused
6 O were used and they became 6 CO in the Krebs Cycle
2 Oxaloacetic Acid were used and reused

"SOME PEOPLE STILL ASK WHY ARE THERE STILL APES OR MONKEYS
It should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works Apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans That is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology 

They might just as well have asked If dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves Or even If Americans came from Europe why are there still Europeans Just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes 

What we know is that the first apes evolved in Africa about 25 million years ago from a population of Old World Monkeys Whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the TOPS of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch Evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment For apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it At one time there were about 30 different  species of apes in those forests

Had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole African continent However conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier As a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the African savanna with just a few scattered trees The shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct

Then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna All apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time  Recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking Chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly

That savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans That gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel They did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened

The apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change They became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos Those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them It set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us",0.0,2947

Animal cell

Eukaryotic cells with membrane organelles and nucleus containing DNA that calls the shots 
Animal plants fungi and protist
Flexible and squishy membranes as oppose to plants allowing the creation of cell organs and tissue types

Cell is like a city

On the surface

Microtubials made of long protein fibers Cillia tiny arms like in lungs and throat pushing the mucus up and Flagella whiplike tail like in sperms Protozoans move with Microtubials instead of muscle tissue
Membrane Selective permeability monitoring coming in and out like boarders

Inside

Cytoplasm waternutrients
Cytoskeleton scaffolding made of protein strands Centrosomes infrastructures
Endoplasmic Reticulum ER network of membranes like a highway system 

The smoother parts of ER are like factories 
containing enzymes proteins producing lipids 
detoxifying substances by adding carboxyl to make them soluble in water 
storing ions like Sodium used for energy

The rougher parts of ER have Ribosomes attached to them
Synthesis and packaging of proteins

Ribosomes float freely assemble amino acids into Polypeptides pushing the protein chain into ER where its bitten off and sent to Golgi Aparatus

Golgi made of membranous layers the post office for packaging proteins cutting them into hormones combining them with Carbs to make molecules
Vessicles the packages with Phospholipid walls

Lysosome waste treatment and recycling sacks containing enzymes breaking down cell waste into building material 

Mitochondria the power plant where respiration takes place fuels converted to Adenosine Triphosphate ATP which is the currency 
They were separate bacteria that animal cells absorbed and kept and they still act as their own organisms with their own DNA they exist in the egg and doesnt mix with sperms DNA during fertilization

Nucleus

The leader
Contains DNA and has all the information and instructions

Has a double membrane
Nucleoplasm is like Cytoplasm
Nucleolus at the center creates Ribosomal RNAproteinsRibosomes

Id love this as a video game Create a Skyrimesque world except where dragons arent mythical creatures but wild animals that could have adequate intelligence and small levels of society like a smart dolphin I think the approach would be cool bc it could be a mechanism for keeping humans in a medieval age since dragons would prey on cities like wolves on sheep,2.0,368
I actually pondered on how dragons would be able to breath fire and I brought the topic up to my mom I had the idea that they had to have an organ in their body that would produce a highly reactive gas or liquid and that when it was forced out it would either ignite from the oxygen or something else would ignite it internally which is where my mom got the idea that Dragons would have a crop like chickens have and throughout a dragons lifetime they would eat rocks of Flint that would go into that crop When the dragon needed to breath fire that crop would constrict extremely fast while the gasliquid came up igniting and sending out flames The Dragons internals being protecting by a thick flame retardant mucus,1.0,728
Since we did dragons and horse paleontology is so rarely touched on a unicorn or other myth creature could be another cool video,2.0,130
Until a few years ago I didnt even know about the dragon  wyvern debate Ive always thought and still do all wyverns are dragons not every dragon is a wyvern just like every duck is a bird but not every bird is a duck Dragon is just a broad term for many different creatures The one with four legs and two wings are european dragons just my way of thinking not saying it as a factnot sure what most peoples opinion is,1.0,437
"A summary

Video Two Water
 H2O uses a covalent bond each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen It is thus a polar molecule
 All water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity  these are hydrogen bonds between the positive and negative poles of different molecules
 Hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion and thus high surface tension
 Cohesion is the attraction between two like things eg two water molecules
 Water has the highest cohesion of any nonmetallic liquid
 Adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things eg water and glass
 Capillary action is water defying gravity
 Water is the greatest solvents due to its polarity 
 Hydrophilic molecules are polar  their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water
 Hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are nonpolar
 Solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily when frozen
 Water has a very high heat capacity  it is good at holding on to heat thus oceans regulate climate and temperature of planets",2.0,1176

"So a bonsai could theoretically become a normal huge tree when planted elsewhere But the question is is a tree happier when it grows way bigger Or is the tree happy when its small too The obvious answer is no the tree doesnt care Another answer would be we have no way of knowing People like to assign emotions to things but a lot of the time those emotions are just selfreflection 

People assign the wrong emotions to animals too even though we know animals can feel emotion people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly This happens all the time 

So even when we find out trees can experience emotion and some evidence already suggests this we would probably still force our own perspective onto them like we do now

What we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do with the conditions they are given Are they satisfied being the tree that they are I dont think trees know this concept I think people shouldnt anthromorphise their idea of succes and satisfaction onto plants In fact people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who dont need it The trees definitely dont need it either",0.0,1187
"Trees never ask for a lighter burden only for broader shoulders

To the people saying that growing bonsais is torture I just want to say that many of the training methods are also applies in other tree nurseries where the trees for parks streets and gardens are grown They are repotted pruned the roots too wired and they get limited amounts of nutrients in order to grow into the desired shape Of course it isnt neccessary to keep bonsais at such a small size when the trees could become much bigger but as long as they are kept healthy I dont see a problem with it I think that few wild trees actually have the resources to grow to their full potential and especially not the ones that grow in urban settings,1.0,661

2 dont go too far down the rabbit hole its better to explain a small amount that they will understand than make everything confusing

The hardest part of that first trick is wrestling a cane away from an old lady at the park Theyre deceptively strong,1.0,119
"My take Probably messed some up

1 The cane gets stabilized by the fact that the lighter side of the cane gets less friction form Your finger than the heavier side so that finger moves faster towards the COM of the cane This causes the effect to flip and the fingers slowly align themselves around the center of mass
2 The phone is not evenly weighed so spinning it in some axis would make it destabilize right Well the same effect is observed when spinning a brick it fell on my foot twice while I tested that that I played around with I believe this effect occurs because of the fact that the center of mass of the brickphone is in the middle of the whole object so rotating it around the axis that allows more mass to rotate around further from the COM will work because the particles far away have to have less momentum the spin is easier On the other hand spinning the phone the other way makes more particles have more energy so this state is unstable The phone starts to spin in a way that makes some of the particles decelerate which is a more stable state rhyme unintended The same thing is observed when spinning around and then extending Your hands out which causes You to decelerate
3 This one is a bit of a troll I tested deuterium water and distilled water and the distilled one produced no less effect Its not the water that is attracted to the cup its the stuff in it ions
4 The cereal contains some iron which is magnetic This makes it attracted to the magnet Maybe but what is interesting is that water and glass fex are pushed away by magnets its diamagnetic Anyways Maybe the magnet makes like a small cavity in the water that the cereal falls into I did not observe one I do not know but I did manage to destroy a box of good cereal and throw the cereal all over the floor

Also for all you wouldbe explainers 2 works for perfectly symmetric objects in a vacuum,1.0,92
"The reason why 1 works isnt just because of the method but because in the first case you only have one finger the center of mass is always a point and since youve only got one point of contact where your finger touches the cane there is effectively a 0 chance the center of mass is exactly on that contact point and thus starts leaning towards one side or another

If you use the second method theres two points of contact and thus as long as the center of mass is inbetween it cannot tilt You can try finding the center of mass on your own with two fingers together without using the special method and just doing it normally and youll see it works fine

TLDR You dont need a special method to balance on the center of mass you just need two fingers so that there are two contact points for the center of mass to be between",1.0,851
4 might have something to do with the 4th phase of water Its a relatively newly discovered phenomena that negatively charged particles inside of water seem to cluster close to nonwater surfaces Theres a chargeless layer after that and then a layer of positive charge which creates a natural bipole which could act as a magnet when stimulated with another magnet and basically push the cereal along and possibly even as work as a battery as the scientist explaining it pointed out Im no expert obviously but there was a Ted talk that I watched on Youtube on the topic which was fascinating I suggest you look it up,1.0,630
First one works thanks to friction when the imbalance occurs friction cancels out the speeds on each side which kind of forces you to move them accordingly so that the momentum on the sides are equal,1.0,201
On the first one it works because when your hand is closer to one side the friction slows it down on each side until when your fingers meet and the object is balanced This should work as long as each hand is moving at relatively the same speed the same force and there isnt any other significant variables,2.0,311

So great to see Leonard Susskind on air This is how physics should be presented  no egos no showboating just great minds discussing complex concepts that us mere mortals can begin to understand,2.0,198
Seriously thank you I particularly am sad that I never pursuid physics in my higher education as these are the subjects that bring colour to my life I think it might not be praised enough that we still get to learn about these amazing ideas even more so from the most incredible field experts for free from anywhere in the world I would like to take these few minutes to show my gratitude towards these actions and to professor Brian Greene Thank you all for your contributions looking for answers or more questions and communicating us the findings forever grateful,2.0,576
I loved when you take a glance at Mark listening to Leonard speak because he just has the biggest smile on his face You can tell how much respect everyone has for each other and their individual interpretations This was a phenomenal listen and I cant wait for more,2.0,268

Thank you Brian and everyone behind the scenes who make WSF you are doing a great service,2.0,91
I hope to see more of Ana I can imagine discussing concepts like this in depth in your non native language would be extremely difficult But I also think that in situations like that the different viewing angle can be very revealing For example there are words in native cultures languages that describe entire concepts in the English language and vice versa Sometimes things that are hidden from one perspective become obvious when looked at from another because parallels between concepts emerge beyond the language itself I think I may have just broken my brain hahaha Anyway I love these Thanks to everyone who was on it and of course Brian,1.0,663
I was gratified  enticed by Dr Susskinds implication of the time shear near the Event HorizonEH because it supports questions I have been asking for years about the structure of a black hole which is commonly dismissed as an unexplainable singularity at the center of the EH  That I have long believed is nonsensical without mention of relative rates of time layering  I note that Feynmans QED is not actually sensible explanatory or even rational but only exquisitely descriptive  This vid also illuminated for me the ubiquitous hairiness of the universe as a thick tangle of EREPR entanglement filaments stretched in at least 4D by an infinitude of time sheared partners  I think this makes the universe a relatively big but very tiny place,1.0,770

Brian is just incredible I loved physics growing up and wanted to be a quantum physicist but also loved medicine and became a doctor but my heart feels alive when I read any papers on quantum physics and attend such lectures  may be one day I will become physicist for now I learn through such amazing videos and papers thanks so so much,2.0,339

Michio is such a gem for the world  Pushing our minds is always a good thing I dont understand most of his ideas but I try it he is so inspirational,2.0,154
It only took one year of physics at uni to demonstrate to me that I would be better off studying biological sciences   The mind of a high level physicist is an awesome and occasionally strange thing to behold when it is on display   I have great respect for any scientist who is also an educator,2.0,298
Thank you for finally explaining string theory in words a nonphysics person as myself could understand  Now maybe you could explain why it isnt called vibration theory  I believe with that  I would have been more accepting of what you said today years ago,2.0,264
I remember watching Michio Kakus shows on discovery science as a kid he made me interested in science and I probably learned English from those shows and if I traveled back in time to close the TV then its likely I wouldnt go back to being an engineer Im a little sad to see him getting older 10 years later but Im glad that he is as passionate about string theory as ever Its funny how some people can change your life without them ever knowing,2.0,458
I have a theory that I would like to get out If this is the leading theory we are to accept You inspired me when I was a young child Michio Kaku I read your book Hyperspace when I was about 12 and it changed my life I have since been building upon many theories of many great minds such as yourself And I think I have discovered something that I feel I should go public with as soon as possible Ive never written a book before It is intimidating And one day I hope to have your blessing Because without you I may have never come to these ideas And even within my theory there is a place for string theory as it embodies such a theory in a way I hope to meet you one day Thank you for everything ,2.0,729

2400 Interestingly enough at high enough optical intensities beyond those attainable by current lasers it is possible for photons to interact with one another This study of photonphoton interactions is known as nonlinear optics For example two photons can combine to create a photon with twice as much energy However due to these high intensities not being common in daily life this isnt frequently observed outside of laboratories,1.0,444

Hey thanks for including the bit about the neutron lifetime question I have worked on the UCNtau experiment and its nice to see this parameter mentioned as an important question For those curious the lifetime is believed to be around 880 sec but the statistics are still underperforming and of course this result deviates from the older bottlebeam experiments by such a degree that there is not yet a consensus,1.0,418

A similar demonstration of the dropping magnet is a solid metal disk connected to a pivot so it swings through the jaws of a large powerful magnet The metal disk is not attracted to the magnet but when allowed to swing through the magnetic field its motion is slowed and almost stopped If a series of closely spaced slots are cut into the disk and the experiment repeated the disk swings through almost unhindered The slots disrupt the currents needed to generate the opposing magnetic field,1.0,497

These all ultimately lead me to a sense of motivation and question as to whats left to discover

Well I position myself towards LIGO Virgo KAGRA into understanding gravity and gravitational waves

i never took a interest in physics but this dude made me understand the basics of converting gravitational potential to kinetic enegry huge respect,2.0,148
I had and experienced this same experiment in a high school physics class in 1959 as we studied pendulum motion The teacher of that class was a PhD physicist taking a two year sabbatical from a national lab His demonstration also included a lesson in the difference between what we say and what we believe Each of us sat on a high stool as a shotput suspended from the high ceiling by a cable was brought up to within an inch or two of our nose He asked each of us Do you know the laws of pendulum motion Our response was of course Yes Then just as he released the shotput he said Know we will see if you believe them Most but not all sat still as that eight pounds of lead rocketed back towards our noses Only a few ducked away a the last second That was 63 years ago I remember it like it was yesterday Sadly today that teacher would not be able to do that experiment or any of the other amazing things he did in that classroom The lessons are to structured preprogramed and rigid for creative teachers to inspire the young minds and imaginations of their students Plus the specter of liability would be the death of any imaginative and creative teaching,1.0,1186

It always amazed me that when I was in school everything about quantum mechanics was a synonym of something very difficult and counterintuitive thanks to the pop culture and popular science articlesvideos on youtube After studying in university it turned out to be much easier espesially considering that classcial mechanics is not that simple either If i saw this video 5 years ago I would have understood that fact earlier Thank you for this clear and neat explonation,2.0,478
Outstanding work  I somehow managed to understand all of it whilst understanding none of it at each stage  Coming from a nonphysics background and with only a limited understanding of calculus to be able to carry a viewer with my limited ability along is testament to your superb communication  Thank you,2.0,312

Never thought I would understand Dr Penroses answer more than Dr Petersons questions,1.0,89
We need more people like Penrose He is really thinking outside the box He doesnt put assumptions on all the things he learned like many smart people still do We need more people like him who is curious and ask the right questions He truly knows where the black spots are in our knowledge He points them out clearly We are watching a genious of our time 200 years from now he will be known because he was one of the few who understood how little we know and where we should look,2.0,487
Wow I am so glad I discovered Dr Penrose today I wanted to refrain from any comments but I have to say that the Interviewer asked better questions than Dr Peterson and he seemed to understand what Prof Penrose was meaning whilst Dr Petersons brain seemed to shortcircuited a few times My view is that Dr Peterson came in with an upfront agenda not to learn but to convince Kudos to Prof Penrose for schooling Dr Peterson Okay I said enough,2.0,457

Damn this man is sharp for his age My granddad bless his soul only got to live to the age of 79 and in his last 3 years he deteriorated to such a degree that he couldnt function at all It was sad to witness Sir Penrose is 90 now almost 91 and he talks about stuff in a very clear way which most adults arent able to do Amazing,0.0,337
Its crazy to see Dr Jordan Peterson learning When I see him in videos I just assume he knows everything already like he just has a flash drive plugged in somewhere,1.0,168
"Dr Peterson there is another physicist turned philosopher who wrote a lot about the nature of the mind and of consciousness basing himself in his understanding of physics His name was David Bohm He is now deceased but he wrote a book called Wholeness and the Implicate Order in which he discusses several things which might be relevant to this conversation and which I found very enlightening I recommend it to you And while youre at it you might as well also look into his interpretation of quantum mechanics called Bohmian mechanics since you showed interest in quantum theory His interpretation gets rid of the inconsistencyincompleteness from which the standard interpretation suffers in an elegant and easy to understand way and in a way which takes all of the apparent magic out of the theory

I was fascinated to see that Roger Penrose uses Godel incompleteness to support his views on the nature of consciousness since I came to the same conclusions on my own years ago based on the same mathematics So cool to hear my ideas coming from the mouth of such a brilliant man",2.0,1104

Quantum entaglement is a phenomenon that must be researched much more it is simply amazing,2.0,92
The trouble with the holographic notion is POV point of view on the one hand and photon density on the other  then if we had three or more hands all of the substance that cant be projected and of course light speed Having said that I do agree that all of the forces are actually expressions of the same phenomenon that being the interaction of matter energy with the Higgs Field at the plank scale To my thinking this interaction elevates the energy level of the field proportional to the interacting mass and this is gravity the energy level of which creates the effect of the curvature of space So that is another effect that cannot be projected as a hologram,1.0,675
On the Stanford channel I obsessively watched all of Susskinds lectures,2.0,73
So correct A civilization cant only rely on an abstract science but on technology as well,1.0,94
What would it look like if we met the extent of the knowledge God allowed us to know It would be like we were contained inside of a realm like a bubble and so one part of the bubble is connected to the next part of the bubble and it is all connected but we can never know what is outside of the bubble to know how the bubble truly works because we can never be outside the bubble When pressed against the bubble we can see a bit ways outside of it to see that we are inside a bubble like finding balance between the left and right side of a bicycle God set limits of the ocean and of the mountains and of the thickness of our skin and since He will always know more than us He has set limits on what we are allowed to know But it is a good thing to flesh out all the areas we are allowed to know to make use of them,1.0,822

I think weve just found the most intense hype man for trees,2.0,60
The goal of evaporation is to cool down the leaf The reason leafs are green is to avoid absorbing too much radiation The sun produces a lot of energy and similar to humans a tree needs to protect himself from sunlight Think about how hot it gets at solar noon and the fact that the tree needs to sit in direct sunlight for the entire day The tree is literally cooling itself down through evaporative cooling similar to how humans do it through sweating This process is known as evapotranspiration,1.0,505

Im a refrigeration technician and I realized a while back that the water evaporates out of the bottoms of the leaves to refrigerate them when water evaporates the vapor pulls heat from the remaining source water cooling it This is necessary because sunlight has the potential to heat the leaves beyond the temperature they can still function for photosynthesis,1.0,367

"It really depends on whether you are studying at a college or a university how theoretical it gets I just completed my bachelors of computer science at a university and basically programming is not being taught to you just very very minimally You are expected to do learn it yourself on your own and everyone does so anyways It is more a tool that you use for other courses than what you are learning towards
I had a lot of theoretical courses in maths theoretical computer science complexity theory technical computer science Transistors and stuff and practical computer science Algorithms and Datastructures You can use your programming skills everywhere to solve tasks and that is the beauty of it",1.0,722

When I started in Computer Science I was surprised how many of my classmates didnt even like to code  They saw programming as at best a steeping stone to their real career  My CS coursework certainly never taught me much programming  My best teacher was my library of Plum Hall books  In my case a professor liked my code and recommended me as a research assistant which was my first computer job  The position was supposed to go to a CS grad student and I was an undergrad music major  My research areas were mainly data compression and pattern recognition  I was within a stones throw of finishing my music degree when I realized that I met the requirements for a CS degree so I ended up graduating with a CS major music minor even though I had 3 times as many hours in music as CS  In my case I didnt program for long Even though I enjoyed coding my bigger interest was systems and that is the direction I went after graduating,1.0,944
TechLead this is a fantastic video very well done In my experience as a physics major with a minor in math and computer science I found that there are classes in every major that use computers and computer programming extensively In math we used programming to model complex physical systems that you could never do with out numerical analysis  In physics we had a year lab where we made our own high speed data capture card  We programmed it to capture data and then we wrote programs to analyze and display that data I think you are 100 correct when you state that the act of programming is very important for every discipline,2.0,637
I was really under a lot of stress and pressure to pursue a masters degree and I was thinking of doing a computer science degree since I had a bachelors in it too But just like you said apart from 1 or 2 courses here the other courses are havoc The photographer example was spot on This video REALLY helped me change my perspective Thanks a lot I really feel like this video was tailor made for me Thanks again  Subscribed ofc ,2.0,439
for me what got my career in coding started was my experience as a student programmer for a company near my university that hired me on basically as an intern They hired me because I worked for them on my Senior capstone project fall semester so I worked for them as an intern during my last semester through that following summer and then I landed my first full time job in the fall I would have stayed with them had they been talking to me and expressed interest in actually treating me like an actual employee,2.0,520

Pretty good summary I disagree with the statement that it isnt a science however CS researchers routinely make falsifiable claims about the real world and then test those claims through experiments In fact thats how Im spending my winter holiday  Like If I solve this problem with method X instead of method Y I get a more reliable answer Of course if you only have empirical evidence ie its been tested in the real world your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof So in that way it might be that some problems CS folks tackle are scientific empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics But some big popular branches of CS like Machine Learning and AI advance primarily through empirical rather than mathematic evidence Whether mathematics itself is a science I will leave to the writers of dictionaries ,1.0,885

What I love about computer programming in particular is that unlike any other subject taught in schools this one forces students to use the creative and logical parts of their brains for once What every country needs for success is smart people that can come up with solutions so I believe computer programming is something that should be taught from early on in order to train young minds Of course its not for everyone I know people who wont understand it no matter how they explain it to them but then again mindless memorizing is not for everyone either,2.0,567

"As a computer science major who will soon be working in NYC as a software engineer I agree with many of the points in this video My firstyear salary will exceed 100k after only a bachelors degree Although this is due to a combination of several internships done during college  the cost of living in New York and sheer luck and blessings many of my peers are also finding roles with great compensation

"Its been 4 years since graduating with my computer engineering degree Pay is amazing Benefits are amazing Flexibility is amazing The projects are usually interesting There are so many openings in computing There are so many business opportunities as well Its absolutely insane I think companies are really really desperate for talent right now I got lucky ending up in Silicon Valley but there is no doubt in my mind that the degree is extremely lucrative anywhere in the developed world At my university computer engineering was 85 computer science 15 electricalelectronics engineering Its functionally equivalent to computer science as far as the industry is concerned I chose to take robotics electives in school but dont actually use those skills in my job Im just a standard software developerengineer Haha

I have a friend who went the boot camp route and struggled a lot in the field being the first target during layoffs and having to learn A TON of stuff that boot camps just dont cover With some tutoring and some years of onthejob training he is doing OK now too Id definitely recommend the degree route as it lays the complete foundation and gives you the flexibility to learn about some of the more advanced specializations like machine learning artificial intelligence programming languages computer graphics game development distributed systems and more in a controlled learning environment with ample timing before jumping straight into the subset of the industry youre interested in",2.0,1544

"A good video as always As a CS major myself this is actually finally a series where I can answer questions and stuff in the comment section Just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info

1 There are also not versions of all the gates AND OR and XOR become NAND NOR XNOR respectively They are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate While they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts You often here people verbally NAND and XNOR when talking about logic so I think it is interesting to note even though this isnt computer engineering

2 While by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false this is often not the case when we actually look at real components Because of power usage the opposite is often used Generally the more common output is set to 0

3 0 doesnt actually mean nothing is flowing through For example we may set our 1 to 5 volts and our 0 to 23 volts This allows for us to have an off state at 0 volts We wouldnt want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off There are also other uses for this state but this may be covered in a future video",2.0,1247

CS requires a person who is patient persistent creative in solutions Basically not someone who sees a wall and says i am done Thats how you can know Further as you grow into CS you will find out that you have been taught how to solve any problem even if not from this field think research learn craft Every experience that you go through will you improve at those steps You will graduatelly stumble across moments where you will be overwhelmed and its ok because you also learn that progress is through error after error only for the new problem to come to you and apply the same process you already can handle being overwhelmed,2.0,650
To add to this  CS is also a major for those who like to practice outside the classroom I am a current CS major at Lawrence Technological University and the majority of my programming practice came from implementing the techniques taught in class to personal projects outside of the curriculum I believe this is an important element to the CS degree path in order to get really good,2.0,386

Currently it says to swap items at index and smallest Since index would be at the end of the array whenever that line is executed as it is after the inner forloop this would swap the last and smallest elements rather than putting the smallest element in its correct position",1.0,405

"Ive always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we as humans seem to sort things it seems like were much more efficient than many of the algorithms at least the ones Ive seen which is admittedly few For example when we look at all the items we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once eg oh I remember that was the smallest before I found the actual smallest so thats the second smallest Let me put both of them first and second right now saving myself a relook I know computers are still faster in the end but I suspect thats because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data and possibly our brain has a slower clock speed rather than computational efficiency Anyone know if thats true

Has anyone made a human sort algorithm so to speak that sorts the way we do including our little tricks Im guessing no If not are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two like the one I just described",2.0,1088
"Just a few things to note about the bigoh notation discussed in this episode

In industry bigoh notation alone is what is seen when discussing algorithms However in academia it is a bit more in depth On is instead used to represent an upperbound in the WORST CASE what is this problem or algorithm n pronounced bigomega is used to represent the lowerbound in the BEST CASE what is this problem or algorithm n prounounced theta without the big is used to represent the tightbound used when the bigoh is equal to the bigomega which is the exact running time There is also small omega and small o but those are rarely used

Also we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation So if a problem takes 5n4  3n2  1 to do we just say it is n4 We drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big

You may notice that earlier I mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation This is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem For example for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix we have n2 since we know that we at least need to read in n2 values This problem currently has On23728639 which is the running time of an algorithm created by Francois Le Gall in 2014",1.0,1379

I totally agree with him Before joining this course I couldnt even attend a 50 min class in my uni with my full conscious But I attended their first class of approx 5 hours with full interest So if you want to learn Python or Web or AI or CS  basics which he mentioned in the video do give them a try Its worth it,2.0,320
Yes this is what was able to get me to wrap my head around coding For anyone thats getting deeper into learning web dev stuff I highly recommend Scrimba It has a great problemsolving based approach to learning where you get small challenges constantly so you can come up with the solution by tying what youve learned together instead of just showing you the solution first Theres also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloudbased coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so its very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor You can pause it at any time and directly edit the code thats being written during the tutorial,2.0,835

Dr Chuck is a legend,2.0,22
I did my undergrad in Computer Science and Im finishing up my MS in Computer Engineering It always drives me nuts when people ask what I do and then assume either is just programming or software engineering I try to explain it like this Computer Science is centered around mathematicscomputational science and problem solving developing algorithms and optimization Programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems Computer Engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems I always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took ComputerElectrical Engineering as undergrads Because they generally speaking are simply trying to make X thing work and I am trying to make X thing run as efficient as possible You can take several different paths to become a coder but theres very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines Anyone looking at going to school for Computer Science should understand this You are learning to be a problem solver first coding is secondary Anyone can learn to code But being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career If you go down this path you are going to be doing far more math than coding and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code You will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts libraries and frameworks But those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use I hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into,0.0,1610

When I took my exams so I can get in a university I really wanted to study architecture or art However things didnt go well and my score was extremely low so I was left with a few options One of them was computer science and telecommunications And tbh despite the fact that I had zero interest in programming before I freaking love this major so much Sure its hard and frustrating af but every day you learn something new and it feels so good when you run your code and it actually works,2.0,495
Andrew Tanenbaum books on CS helped me a lot during uni years and sometimes during discussions at work but they give theoretical knowledge not practical applications,2.0,165
My biggest tip if youre a computer science student and have the chance it was not required at my college to take software engineering make sure you take all the software engineering classes you can because thats what youll be doing  Most of CS is a lot of abstract data structures and ideas that you may never even ever use but knowing the pipeline of actually creating software and those different methodologies Agile which is just old school RAD with more crap to have to deal with Waterfall Spiral etc etc will give you a better idea of what youll be doing on the day to day  Youll tailor your data structure and algorithm knowledge to what youre tasked with at work but the software engineering portion youll use anywhere you go,1.0,755

"Hey everyone 
after some years of experience I know by myself how difficult it can get when learning and optimizing programming skills 
A few days ago I had a very interessting nerdy conversation about this topic with a very good friend of mine who is also in the programming business for many years
The question which fascinated me the most was  how one could make the lives of programmer a lot easier
The reason why i tell you this is because I am very exited about your opinion on this topicEspecially the following 2 questions would interest me the most
1 As programmer what are were the 2 biggest issues youre dealing with
2 Regarding your programming skills what would you wish for more than anything else


Thanks so much in advance  looking forward to reading your answers",2.0,799
Thanks Great advice just starting out pursuing a BA CS after being out of school for 20 years  I have been having a similar dilemma I originally signed up for software development but my counselor said I should do CS since I said I want the ability to be hands on on top of developing  Not sure if I am thinking too big but thanks great video,2.0,357
To hear that you didnt have any preparation before college makes me feel better for being in the same position I really didnt have any experience with code other than html and felt behind because other student because half of them either smarter or extremely experienced with the area,2.0,290

I go to ODU  so do you actually feel like you learned a lot in 350 I havent taken it yet but a lot of people Ive talked to say its massively outdated and just a ton of busy work I understand that can help you practice discipline but was it useful any other way in getting ready for your career,1.0,302
So my University currently has both Software Engineering and Computer Science Both majors are pretty much the same thing and the only difference is about 3 or 4 classes For example for the Data Structures and Algorithms course there is CIS 350 theory based and CIS 3501 SE side of the class also the core requirements has SE majors take SE 2 after SE 1 while CS majors only take SE 1 So its really the same degree same requirements only difference is a couple of classes that are very similar,1.0,506

This reminds me a lot of the YouTuber Pezzzas Work his Ants Simulation videos make sure to watch that It is analogous to the market speedrunning anything really",2.0,536
"Been excited for this video for awhile Ive heard of TSP superficially many times but never got a deep dive like this before Very motivated exceptionally beautiful and naturally narrated Content like this is the gem of YouTube 

Just to add As impossible as this problem is its wild to know we have a record solution with a tour length of 75 billion",2.0,363
Im quite impressed that you managed to avoid mentioning entropy while discussing the annealing approach and the pheromone approach I once tried to explain pheromone optimization to a friend of mine who wasnt familiar with using entropy to backtrack a search and I simply wasnt able to explain the process Well done,2.0,321
PSPACE problems common in planning are arguably harder as TSP is only NPhard,0.0,85
I did a report in Linear Algebra discussing using Adjacency Matrices to find paths from any point to any other point by raising matrices to their power step by step  I managed to make it work for minimum hop count and shortest path between two points  Unfortunately it doesnt solve the TSP because it does not go back to it starting point only that it can hit every point  We had another idea of using something similar to what we called gravitic weighting to image creating the shortest path by picking any point and then lifting it and seeing the other points fall based upon distance we ran into problems with pruning of ineffecient routes if we could identify routes that were not going to be used we think it would have worked unfortunately our advisor didnt seem to care to help us at all to him TSP was just an impossible problem and we were waisting our time,1.0,883

"This is for some of you incoming freshman who may be worried about cs if u have never coded before

I was a freshman data science major last year and I had never written a single line of code I got a C in my intro to Java course and I was very disappointed as it was something I really want to pursue I was worried about my performance in the next course Software 1 and if my grade would be lower I worked on my own projects to better understand the logic and I ended up finishing with an A in the next course and this was all over the course of one winter break Now Im making apps with swiftUI and solving data science machine learning problems in python And this was all over the course of a year Dont be afraid if you struggle early on its a part of the journey",0.0,778
My advice as someone who just graduated with a CS degree and was also a peer tutor is to take the time to do your work and understand the code that youre writing Too many times I see people slap shit together and then wonder why it doesnt work,0.0,246
Im in 4th year of my CS studies right now Unfortunatelly I needed to realize all of the stuff you mentioned on my own I feel like in some cases it can be a little bit late I just hope somebody would talk to me about this at the beggining I would say to all new CS students This will be harder than you think But the balance is the most important thing,1.0,362
Im starting collegeuni this year in the Computer Science course This was so timely,2.0,86
Another thing Ive found helpful as a CS major is to make sure to capitalize on those required gened classes subjects like History English Philosophy etc Having a spare 100level Intro to X class in your workload during a tough quarter doing hours upon hours of JavaPython can really defray the pressure Many of these are also just as good when taken online as well,2.0,378
"Great tips I would also like to say that understanding logic is very important My professor really stressed this in my first programming class He said that he has interviewed graduates who got through their entire college career through trial and error I think that he is right Unless you can explain every single piece of your code line by line you dont really understand the logic behind it 

In fact he makes us go to the lab and the TA asks us to explain our code line by line if we want the full marks on the assignment",2.0,535
"never say Ill do it later when it comes to assignments and projects
Ill write some more tips later",1.0,104
Another tip is to take your time Dont force yourself into like 56 classes 4 classes 3 majors one elective would be your best friend,1.0,139
My advice Get into your schools CS discords and class specific discords if they have them or make one if there isnt  Graduate and undergraduate students work together to give lots of resources for all students and it help a lot Especially with what proffesors are good and bad they help with assignments and even answer general questions,2.0,347

35 mins in i am absolutely engrossed  loving the concise breakdown Much love,2.0,80
Steven this video was awesome You clearly put a lot of preparation into your lessons and the slide visuals are top notch compared to most other CS educational videos You definitely earned a subscriber,2.0,204
I failed my precalc class my first semester of college I did an easier math class the second semester and passed it Im ready to try the precalc again Even though I failed the class I learned that math is one of the most beautiful languages in the world Math is great Im not good at it by any stretch I will still conquer this though,2.0,342
"The reason sooo many fear and fail at math is not because it is hard It is because they treat it like the other basic education subjects 
Think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before remembering a few equations like dates in history class nor by just scrapping by 
Office hours are the key to succeess yes But even more important than that you MUST COMPLETE ALL HOMEWORK WHEN DUE AND DONT EVER GIVE UP ON A SINGLE PROBLEM THEN YOU MUST PRACTICE PRACTICE 
Dont study Only practice That way you dont just know you have complete UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CONCEPTS Much like pointing out a particular color in the room you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing like identifying red  letters S T O P means stop how to approach the problem and what equation formula etc to use Tools in a toolbox Baby",0.0,960
Calculus Discrete Math Linear Algebra IS A MUST,2.0,52
Lmao just changed my major to CS and was nervous for the math portion Then I realized Im not actually that bad at math and I was making it seem worse than it was Dont know if that will change when the semester starts but Im excited Gotta say thank you Forrest youre the reason I felt confident in changing my major to Computer Science,2.0,342
Throughout my life I always viewed math as something negative and sucked at it However during freshman year of college I decided that computer science it is and started out taking basic math classes prealgebra Currently I am taking Precalculus and will go up to Calc 2 What made me get to where I am is the mindset,1.0,322
its important to note that it also depends on your college some CS departments like the engineering department requires lot of math while others dont like arts and sciences,1.0,173
Thanks for the video Getting into my first math CS courses and its been challenging but youre absolutely right Hard work is what helps you get better at math and understand concepts not memorize formulas,2.0,209
This is a reall helpful video thanks considering I want to go into CS Videos about your process to solving complex problems would be great since Im doing pure math in school ,2.0,178
Hey Forrest Im starting as a freshman in a few weeks and Im wondering what your thoughts are on pursuing a computer science degree online as apposed to a physical college Any insight would be greatly appreciated ,2.0,219
I stumbled upon your page a few days ago and I must say its been the best learning experience in terms narrowing down specific areas to focus on Excellent content,2.0,165
Kirby this year really is just the gift that keeps on giving,2.0,60
This is really cool My only gripe is that its only 2 player local and not 4 when wireless and online are 4 playeralthough its likely frame rate issues hopefully they add 4 player local in the future but other than that the game looks like great fun,2.0,257
Finally a game that truly gets me on a spiritual level,2.0,56
I love that Elfilin already has stuff in this game Forgotten Land was just before this so I was really surprised to see the stage as well as the cosmetics,2.0,158
I love the part when Kirby is quickly eating the 50 Strawberry Cake I imagine all this fun stuff from Kirbys Epic Yarn when he couldnt contain himself from a giant cake I dont care either gotta love that cake,2.0,217
I love how you can add Dream in front of any regular object and make it a powerful Kirby artifact,2.0,100
Ive seen art of foodbased abilities before but not traditional abilities in the style of foods It works unexpectedly well,2.0,126
"Yo This looks soooooo fun The variety of modes  cosmetics competitive  coop options etc  for 15 YAYUS

I also love the attention to detail  references like Master  Crazy hand or the hands in some of the menus at 040 64 Needle Kirby in 155  a Smash Bros reference at 254",2.0,297
This looks pretty fun only big let down is it seems to only go up to two players in local splitscreen,2.0,103
The pricing is really good here Great job Nintendo,2.0,52
Sonic can totally pull off more serious stories like in Adventure 2 Im glad theyre taking that approach with Frontiers Im optimistic about this one,2.0,153
"It seems like theyre actually going for a serious story this time I hope they manage to pull it off The cutscenes look so gorgeous and the areas do to I was pretty sold on playing this game but now Im really excited 
Also this comment is gonna be really dated depending on what the game is like when it comes out I guess itll be like my own little time capsule to revisit years later",2.0,393
Whether or not this Sonic plays out to what we want it to be we should give thanks to the people that spend many hours developing this game Looks great ,2.0,154
Im loving the cyberspace stages and story so far Nice to see another island in this trailer too Cant wait to get this at Christmas Maybe itll be one of the few games Ive 100d,2.0,183
I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope they dont screw this one up Like Id like to actually hear good things about a mainline 3D sonic game made by sonic team thats actually good,2.0,173
Beautiful finally a new sonic game that does justice for the original series the first showcase was strange but this one is definitely better compared to the old one,2.0,168
I cant understand why some areas look genuinely breathtaking then others are just floating disjoined rails and walls I dont understand how theres such a massive difference,0.0,177
I always love when sonic is more serious instead of cracking jokes hopefully he takes things seriously in this game,2.0,116
So this actually looks good As long as Egghead doesnt come back as another villain pulling the strings looks promising,2.0,123
Finally a trailer that makes Sonic Frontiers look exciting,2.0,60
Tickets for IndieLand 2022 are on sale now httpindieland2022eventbritecom,1.0,80
The 3DS is probably my favorite system of all time With access to all DS games and the impressive digital library almost no other system library can compare The library isnt only large its diverse There are bangers for every genre of game All of this is a portable package,2.0,281
I recently started playing Kid Icarus Uprising and apart from needing to take a few breaks to rest my hands I am shocked with how much fun Im having with it and Im bummed that there hasnt been a sequel made since then,2.0,223
"Love the 3DS

Planet Robobots true arena is one of the most satisfying challenges to overcome across all games Would be 1 on my personal list

Great memories of playing Smash Run w friends while getting lunch or wutever else",2.0,230
Fire Emblem became one of Nintendos larger series thanks to the 3DS I dont really play Fates or SoV anymore but I still find myself revisiting Awakening love that game If you can step outside of your completionist mindset youd probably love it,2.0,249
I was surprised Kid Icarus Uprising isnt on here I think its the best 3DS game Its a true masterpiece Yet again Sakurai developed this game too and a lot of his games are gold Hes a very hard worker and has high expectations for his games,2.0,250
3DS just felt so special I didnt expect it but found myself really into Pokmon Sun and Moon I think Pokmon Refresh was a huge addition to making me attached to my team and I found myself tearing up in a lst battle when my Mismagus held on to the end for me I know it ruins the game for some people the Pokmon holding on has a higher rate of stopping KO than the focus band apparently but dont quote me on that but for me it was JUST want i wanted as a jaded almost30 year old who really just wanted to enjoy the game,2.0,530
Smash on 3DS was a marvel in its own right The fact the 3DS could handle it AND at 60FPS on the OG 3DS was absolutely mind blowing to me for the time,2.0,151
"My favorite series is the Dillons Rolling Western series I remember going on the eshop to find The Last Ranger being advertised However I wouldnt get it until I grew up a bit more Dillons character stood out when I am already attracted to stylized games 
All three of the games are tower defense where you are trying to clear waves as fast as possible Currently all of the games are exclusive to the eshop Unless you live in a PAL region those games will be lost to time",2.0,482
Kid Icarus Uprising is my favourite game of all time The combat is fun the weapons are cool the characters are funny and layered and the story and world building is fantastic  Its been half the time there was between the last two games in the series but I will gladly wait another 10 years to get more Kid Icarus goodness,2.0,328
I know this will get overlooked but I really wanna give props to the announcer she did a fantastic job and put so much energy into the announcement it honestly made me pretty hyped,2.0,183
For those who didnt notice the store manager for the locker items is Harmony a character that has actually been somewhat present before in the series Shes part of the musical band known as Chirpy Chips that plays all sorts of battle music in Splatoon 2 If you look it up shes right there on the album cover,1.0,315
"I love how the splatoon colour themes are based on complimentary colours opposite colours for example

Splatoon 1  orange and blue
Splatoon 2  pink a green
Splatoon 3  yellow and purple

Some of the colours are slight variations such as pink its meant to be red but pinks a good substitute",2.0,298
"For those who have questions about this Direct

1 you can actually skip the news this time

2 Salmon run can be played at any time

3 in Rainmaker there are multiple checkpoints now",1.0,184
Ill always love splatoon They never take away things that people have always liked and instead they either make it better or add on things weve wanted Im just really obsessed because Ive always loved this game since I was little ,2.0,237
whoever this announcer was definitely needs a raise everything was so easily digestible and im glad new players can find their way even easier she sounded so energetic intrigued and passionate overall this 30 minute direct was beautifully executed,2.0,255
Im going to miss the idols from Splatoon 2 they slayed perfect character design and wonderful personalities I didnt expect we would get three idols Big man Shiver and Frye They seem to have a lot of potential Im looking forward to doing story mode too The gameplay must be amazing,2.0,293
I was genuinely afraid I thought the game would be identical to the second or even worse  But this Direct definitely made me change my mind  There are crazy news the setting is much more oriental than that of previous games and I love it  New weapons story mode that feels spatial practically a free choice of character customization of much more  I have no negative comments the only flaw could be a short duration of the Story mode which for lone players like me could be a problem but I sincerely hope Im wrong ,2.0,529
The expressions of the characters are perfect and everything looks so lively like the inklings have actually remade civilisation but no humans Nintendo doesnt just cease to be awful They dont know how to,2.0,208
"The announcer here and on the direct is so good She sounds so energetic and passionate and it fits the game really well and gets me excited to play even more

I am so unbelievably hyped up for this game omg

Ive been a fan of Splatoon one but I didnt get a hold of the game until Splatoon 2 cause I was poor lol
I legit cant wait to play this every day",2.0,358
Im definitely interested to see harvestella shown off The concept sounds really cool but the trailer left me with very little idea as to how it would actually work so Im interested to see more,2.0,197
Itd be nice that even when digital takes over for games that they offer a buy from the manufacturer option where you could order a physical copy online and get it shipped from wherever they made the game Because I fully expect digital merchandise to be abusedcapitalized in some way out of favor for the consumer,1.0,316
For these kinds of shows I think Id prefer a rapidfire series of announcements in 3060 minutes followed by a lengthier presentation going indepth into specific games That way those that are interested in a specific title can check out the deepdive of that game in specific after the main presentation,1.0,310
Wanted to wish everyone a Happy Wednesday today  love watching your video game news everyday Jon keep up the great Work ,2.0,122
I am actually kind of looking forward to harvestella its a very pretty game,2.0,79
The fact that the version of RE7 that came out was considered marketings worst nightmare shows you that listening to marketing people is a foolish idea when it comes to creative endeavours,0.0,192
After seeing that new Splatoon 3 spawning cannon thing for the tenth time I just realized its how the developers wanted to tackle spawn camping which was a nightmare in the prior games,1.0,187
Gamescon had quite a few games that peaked my interests but that sony edge controller was the most intriguing Looks like we can hot swap joysticks which could be a fix to combat drift,2.0,185
Whenever I see a company announce a release date I never take it seriously anymore and almost expect there to be a delay,0.0,120
As term of gamescom I was excited for Gotham Knights villain trailer and the release moving up to October 21st Im still getting day 1 Im excited for Castillo protocol Im excited for sonic frontiers finally getting a release date in November And I loved the new trailer of Hogwarts legacy,2.0,292

Return to Monkey Island could be interesting and just hearing the music is really nice I like the style but its a pretty big change from what Im used to seeing
Kenta looks really charming and adorable I adore the concept
Dragon Quest Treasure seems like a real blast I love being able to fight alongside companions It makes me miss Dragon Quest Monster Joker
Theres a lot of promise coming up but Nintendo please It was a huge 3DS hit Please remaster or remake Tomodachi Life",2.0,581
Nintendo just put out a better Sonic trailer than Sega did This should have been the first trailer for the game It makes so much more sense than the weird rollout Sega did,2.0,173
This might be in the running for the best direct ever So little downtime each announcement was ranging from cool and not my thing to wow,2.0,139
THANK YOU FOR FINALLY PUTTING PERSONA 5 ON THE SWITCH I HAVE BEEN WAITING,2.0,74
I do quite like how the splatana feels like a samurai stealth based ninja weapon Diversifies the gameplay quite a bit,2.0,120
"Wellworded and gracefully honest It does like quite the quality title Im excited as a hardcore Splatoon fan I have 670 hours on 2 so small changes still do mean a lot to me after playing the second game for the past 5 years

Of course it doesnt hurt to want just a little bit more for a sequel Im hoping that future additions to the game will help it to become even better",2.0,384
The power eggs always had a use You could buy weapons and upgrade them using the power eggs Within the single player,1.0,118
The graphics actually look a lot smoother more intricate and more polished as well as the frame rate and overall flow of movement which is super nice I wasnt expecting a graphical improvement after the first footage we saw but now Im happy,2.0,247
"I wasnt really expecting any new formula for the Single Player  Im completely fine with the stuff you mentioned Maybe theyll explore new things in the paid DLC

From the trailers Ive seen  your gameplay you get shot onto the stage for Turf Wars  Anarchy Battles thus getting rid of team specific spawn areas Perhaps thats what made the maps feel bigger Cant wait to see how they update the SplatoonSplatoon 2 stages",2.0,428
I guess in terms of a single player mode for Splatoon 3 I was hoping for a Bowsers Fury type of world where it feels more grand some exploration and seemless transitions into the levels,2.0,190
I feel like the biggest sell for Splatoon 3 is the timing With the switch being as old as it is now most people have a switch in their home So for kids this is a big buy especially if you havent played it yet but all your friends are playing it I havent played in a few years and Im really excited Just to chill enjoy all it has to offer along with the community surrounding it Its a lot easier to sell this game to a Japanese audience as well because of all the marketing and promotional events after the game comes out As well as the IRL concerts with their in game idols,2.0,588
My biggest hope for splatoon three is to get it and have fun playing through the waves of content as they tend to be fun and hype as they come out that being said for outsiders of the community Im disappointed and really wish that it gives enough to entice new fans and not just old ones,1.0,289
I honestly hope its great considering that Splatoon is my  personal 2nd favorite Nintendo franchise behind Mario,2.0,113
I am LIVING for the revolutionary joke Gonna be giggling about that for a while Great breakdown and honest feedback,2.0,118

I remember trying to pass the first pinball in Waluigi Pinball as a young kid The feeling of accomplishment you got from beating it too the ramp where it falls was great Definitely one of my favorite tracks The pinball machine segment the most chaotic place in any track that gets more chaotic every lap which may be why its so popular,2.0,341

"Questions
Does the DRM appy to anything played on the Switch or just some upcoming titles Do I need an internet connection to play on the Switch Im always connected so I had no idea this might be the case Will DRM make the switch unusable in another console generation or two",0.0,281
This is part of why I stick with the older consoles All these servers network logins and DRM stuff just ruins gaming for me I just like popping the game in and playing,0.0,172
It will probably not be an online check DRM I saw a flash of a website in the video on emulation piracy DRM Denuvo probably thinks that they have a way for a game to be able to run a check to see if its running in an emulated environment Based on their history using kernelmode DRM  anticheat BS on the PC I would avoid any switch game running anything from denuvo,0.0,374
The thing with drm like denuvo is that it literally pushed piracy more Ive had a couple of friends with RE 8 on PC that literally got the pirated version downloaded just cause it performs 100x better And for me personally I bought the ultimate version of dying light 2 I really enjoyed it but i had to lower settings cause I thought my PC couldnt handle it or something but then I tried out the cracked version and then all of a sudden the game runs like butter I hate denuvo and if used frequently on switch It will ruin games and even trust from the fanbases,0.0,570
"Its also worth noting that the primary assumption behind DRM is that people that would pirate a game if theres no DRM would legally buy the game if theres DRM  Thats a really absurd assumption  Most people that are actually doing the pirating would otherwise not buy the game at all so their piracy has a net zero impact on the developer

And DRM gets cracked in only a few months so the pirates need only wait anyway

DRM does only one thing and thats punish the people that legally buy the game",0.0,509
The eff is what I said immediately Denuvo does not stop piracy It kills game performance,0.0,91
Thats exactly what switch games need Something to hinder the performance and bog stuff down Brilliant,0.0,105

Heres our revisit review of Lego Star Wars with patch 107  hopefully this helps anyone looking for latest information on the Nintendo Switch version through our All Patched Up format Mark,2.0,192
The fact that you revisit some patched games is one of the things I love most about your channel  While Ill say that many games should not release in the poor state that they do such is the state of the gaming world in 2022  You guys do all of a wonderful service by updating your reviews when possible  Thank you,2.0,319
Its easy to be harsh on the Switch and the way some ports perform but its amazing to have full games like this on the move When developers get it right it really sings,2.0,170
This is why I love this channel they dont just abandon games at a review,2.0,73
I suppose its because I grew up when all video games had pop in so it doesnt really create a negative connotation for me with a game  I know that if a game isnt wholly designed for the Switch that issues can occur with frame rates pacing and the like but it is always nice to see when developers continue to work on and iron out the problems with their games I think the patch was needed and accomplished what it was supposed to,2.0,435
A note for your souldiers revisit while the patch fixed a lot of the worst issues the fire temple a late game area is still prone to a lot of  crashing when saving at dragon swords it was 5050 every time I saved in that dungeon whether it would crash or not didnt get any crashes anywhere else so Im not sure why that area specifically is so problematic it was also an area where one room in particular had a game breaking performance bug before the big patch,0.0,470
I preordered this and I didnt really notice much of the original issues but I think thats because I was just enjoying the gameplay and I was mainly playing handheld on an OLED but its always good to see developers going back and fixing things to improve the game,2.0,265
Glad the performance has gotten better on split screen I stomached it the first time through but might return to mess around Knew this game had potential on the switch,2.0,170
Theres so many things that annoyed me about this game and I ended up quitting well before completion I really like games with tight responsive controls where you can learn techniques to have complete mastery over your characters move set This game was like the opposite to that ,0.0,284
"I nearly got 100 completion with this game Had to stop after more than a couple of side quests had a weird performance issue where it would stutter beyond belief It took a lot of patience but if you could finish the quest the stuttering stopped It was frustrating Usually they were quests where you had to find things that were all around a planet so you had to traverse large areas Trying to do so when every input took several seconds to respond was too much for me 

Now Im stuck on some backlog games so I dont know if Ill ever have 100 completion But maybe one day",0.0,588
im so glad that the direction theyre going with when it comes to chaos is pure expression and a sense of warmth rather than falling into the trap of being edgy,2.0,164
It almost sounds like a blend of Indian Japanese and Brazilian culture which really brings out the idea of diverse unity and expressionism that chaos is all about I love it,2.0,177
I absolutely love how Chaos is used Instead of being like an apocalypse or something the chaos is presented as a huge jumble of culture Love it,2.0,147
Whoever mixed this song is a genius They managed to fit so many cultures in such a small amount of time and managed to perfectly make fake squid language sound great all whilst making a genuinely slapping song,2.0,212
dont get me wrong the concert vibe from the other games was cool but this fees like a whole festival and its really refreshing,2.0,130
shivers part sounds like traditional japanese songs big mans part sounds like a bit of brazilian funk maybe fryes part sounds like its traditional from middle eastern and the chorus sounds like samba im in love with this song,2.0,234
I love the music but another thing I noticed is how different every idols dance was They had their own unique way of dancing according to their culture and it makes me so happy to see a mashup of multiple cultures in one performance,2.0,236
The only bad thing about this song is that it ends,0.0,51
Not sure if anyone else had noticed this but when I rewatched this again I saw that the platforms that Shiver Frye and Big Man were standing on actually connect together The bottom part makes up a fish Shivers platform is the head Big Mans the middle part and Frye is the tail Very subtle detail I love it,2.0,318

The biggest advantage the Aya Air has over the steam deck is the steam deck isnt available in all countries and regions to buy and this should be so people have the option to get this,2.0,188
"Hmm Id still go with the Steam Deck This is more expensive and looks like it performs worse The only thing going for it is the OLED screen Plus I think the Steam Deck will last longer with its powerful hardware and Valves continued support 
Plus Im not sure how to feel about Aya Neo They release a new console every 6 months which makes me question their dedication to support in the long run And they were WAY too expensive and probably only brought the price down on this new one because of the Steam Deck
Edit Should probably finish watching the video before writing a comment because you said pretty much everything I said haha",0.0,651
Just to note Gulikit also makes joystick replacements for the Steam Deck I saw LTT install it not too long ago and recently picked me up a pair,1.0,145

Im in the same boat i EXCLUSIVELY play portably now So much so that i dont touch my ps4 anymore im entirely on the switch I dreamt of having the yakuza series being portable and working well but with options like the aya neo  steam deck i can have that Love this new generation of portable gaming its INSANE,2.0,320
Wood Thanks for reviewing this and introducing me to a new controller I know you were mainly focusing on the mini streamdeck but still I had never heard of it and I was looking for something like that because believe it or not my pro controllerjoycons all HAVE STICK DRIFT so finding a controller that addresses that problem is exactly what I needed especially when its got gyroscope capabilities too I play splatoon so I need gyro and sticks with no drift of course,2.0,480
"Honestly that tricolour three team mode was what sold the game to me Its just a shame that its limited to Splatfests only I felt like as a mode that was the truly unique and franchisepushing idea of a mode that warranted a whole sequel Oh well I guess Nintendos servers wouldnt be able to handle it

At the moment this is just what Splatoon 2 should have been back in 2017 to me Splatoon really needs to evolve beyond the first game in quite tremendous or advanced ways in order to actually feel like a true sequel the tricolour mode was close to that principle but alas its only limited to Splatfests  otherwise Stay Fresh is just a quote of sheer irony because Splatoon has thus far to me not proven to stay fresh",0.0,745

It looks neat The screen looks slightly bigger and it looks like a quick cash grab if u have the original Switch and the Switch Lite I love playing the Switch on table top mode with the Switch Pro controller It feels more comfortable and it gives u that lil home console feel,2.0,279
THANK YOU You just gave a good review unlike the stereotypical reviews that only bring up the its just a larger screen and thats it reviews that are bandwaggoning trash So thanks very much for this you brought up a few things I didnt yet know about it ,2.0,261
Picked up on OLED and very happy with the bigger screen size Paired with my Hori Split Pro joycons its feels greatthe stock joycons feel small and uncomfy The screen for my old Switch looks like an old cheap tablet now with that huge bezel If you have no fingernails the cart door is way harder to open than the old Switch door,2.0,336
Is it just me or was the original switch more creaky when holding it than the oled The oled seems incredibly solid Not sure if it just loosens overtime,1.0,153
I have the V2 but I do think the OLED is nice I like how it has ethernet supportand I hear it has a padded dock now which they should of done from the beginning but oh well I play only on my TV so I wont be upgrading until a whole new system drops but I give the OLED a 910def worth it for new switch buyers imo,2.0,318
The card slot is way harder to open on the oled sucks for people like me with short fingernails Never had this issue with the original so its baffling as to why they changed it,0.0,180
Love my OLED Such a premium experience compared to the original,2.0,65
If Nintendo makes another Switch I really hope they make the Joycons bigger and more ergonomic,2.0,97
I think the freechoice gym makes sense because in the pokemon world there are trainers who start their journey from towns or cities more advanced than the first village of the main character Imagine if every npc started from Pallet Town that wouldnt make much sense right,1.0,278

I feel like the hill to climb after Arceus is huge I really liked the independence aspect of the game the catching mechanics that didnt require you to battle and no forced encounter in tall grass which allowed you to see the wild Pokmon These new games seem to have kept some of these so Im eager to find out how it will pan out,2.0,338

Lets not deny this guys Despite the Wii U being a huge commercial failure it had a great library of games Its a huge shame the console itself didnt do very well,0.0,168
Despite its terrible sales the Wii U made up a huge part of my childhood and I loved it,2.0,88
Brings back so many memories of my early childhood to now  I remember when I was very little I had the N64 where I first played MARIOKART  Then I was later given as a present the Game Boy  And then I remember later on I wanted the GameCube which I got I think either for my birthday or for Christmas  And thats where I first played Animal Crossing  I played the other versions on the other systems as well  I then asked about a year or two later Santa for a blue DS Lite and a few years later I got the DS i XL which was a surprise present from my grandma  And when I graduated from middle school my grandma got me the Wii as a graduation present  I eventually also got the 2DS only because it was slightly cheaper and now I have the Nintendo Switch  I still love them all and Nintendo to this day  Animal Crossing Super Mario Bros MARIOKART MARIO PARTY and all the other classics are still my favorite to this day  And I cant wait to see Super Nintendo World when it opens at Universal Studios,2.0,1016
Thank you Nintendo for making our childhood memorable I once owned GB Color and Nintendo DS and I had so much fun back in those days,2.0,134
Thank you for this video Now whenever Nintendo talks about how much of a family friendly company they are  similar to what Sakurai said when he was introducing Terry Bogard for Smash Im going to remind them that they once were a love hotel,2.0,244

"Watching this again because my friends got me hooked on video games And after watching animal crossing and Pokmon streams I kinda have been researching which switch would be better for my technology availability 
Now I think I definitely should save up for this one I like bigger screen option and newer version Cant wait to see it available on local stores as I just discovered I could possibly even get it on my mobile carrier contract for less than my iPhone 12 
Also I see this as good option when you dont have smart tv to play games on like my friends and I even looked up possible laptop connections So this one looks right up to my alley Also for when Im willing to give my phone a break or just feel like playing video games which is something Ive only been discovering few weeks ago",2.0,808

In other words the joycons while the optimal method to play the Switch in its entirety are poorly designed for their tasks",0.0,497
Iwata and Reggie were the souls of Nintendo they embodied why every Nintendo fan loved Nintendo myself included every other gaming platform at the time just felt like they were shoving shit down your throat but when Nintendo was showing off stuff it was like they were popping into your living room to show you the stuff theyve been working on and were so proud of it but when they left all that soul of the company left with them Ill always be a Nintendo fan but that doesnt mean theyre at the best were I think they can be,2.0,536

I got my first Switch a month ago the OLED edition and i gotta say its one of my favorite consoles ever I started with the PlayStation 1 then the GameCube Gameboy Advanced SP Wii Xbox 360 3DS XL then really got into PC games and then stopped playing videogames for many years So it was a delight getting the Switch specially because of the great games it has My favorite so far have been Fire Emblem Three Houses Animal Crossing New Horizons and Smash Ultimate Also really surprised with Mario Kart 8 its a lot of casual fun Well this is my paragraph that no one asked for lol Great video btw,2.0,610

This looks a lot better than the version they showed last year Smooth framerate fastpaced action and over the top silliness Welcome back Bayonetta ,2.0,152
Im hoping Jeanne plays more of a role in this game Its going to be the first time that shell be active throughout the story without being mind controlled She really only appeared in the prologue and epilogue last time,2.0,223
Bayonetta deserves even more shine She may not be trending but this third installment will not disappoint,2.0,107
the fact that Sigurd mentions a way to an alphaverse with alpha usually meaning first kinda reinforces the idea that were in the universe where Cereza wasnt sealed away and the climax of the story could probably involve our main Bayonetta because its confirmed were gonna meet other Bayonettas this also kinda ties into how Hellena Taylor tweeted about getting used to not hearing her iconic voice which could mean the kinda low and seductive one she uses for our main Bayo,1.0,486
"Guys if we can see how cool bayonetta looks with her new summons and moves imagine Jeanne I cant wait to see the difference hoping that Jeanne is playable and maybe even with her actual voice actor

Downloading the DLC from NSO feels a little confusing so maybe they just got too many complaints or questions about it plus DLC on NSO is a key part of the benefits so they just want to have it covered My take,0.0,212

"I was recently thinking about what would be next for NSOEP And I thought it would be a great idea if Gameboy and Gameboy Colour get launched on the standard tier in September whilst adding Gameboy Advance and Nintendo GameCube to the Expansion Pack tier in October one year after the Expansion Pack tier had launched

I also think that your idea of Super Mario Odyssey DLC being added would be brilliant",2.0,409
It was about downloading the DLC included with the NSO Expansion which is done differently than other DLC And Im pretty sure it came out to coincide with the new pack of tracks with MK8 Deluxe,1.0,194
The problem is its not telegraphed well to the general user that they have access to the Mario kart tracks for example They need to upgrade their UX and put it in the switch online section of the OS and also message it better My guess when I saw this was that they can see loads of people arent taking advantage of downloading DLC as part of their sub,0.0,356
"About the download DLC video I think its more to explain how to download the DLC for free when youre a NSO member Because I believe many people would think that youd BUY DLC in the eShop but theres an option on the DLC page to download for free So the video is warranted although it shouldve been published last year when NSO launched
",1.0,350
After going through and seeing the user interface the download button is not as prominent as the proceed to purchase button is obvious  I can see people hitting the purchase button thinking that will get them to where they need to go but then they see that they have to pay for it and get frustrated  I have some experience with UXUI design so that stands out,0.0,369

And Im calling it the vacuum specials going to be called the Sucker Shot Well that was a disappointment And after theyd done so well with other names like Killer Wail Echolocator Bubbler Inkjet etc",1.0,535
I really love the added player titles and medals awarded to the players at the end of each match Not to mention the music is HARD Just 4 and a half months and the wait will finally be over,2.0,192
"What I have gleamed from this is that Ill definitely be playing turf war a lot more in this installment The specials look like they actually benefit turf war compared to the previous versions and will definitely be a lot more fun overall in ranked modes 

I love the aggressive approach to the specials too reverting back to what splatoon offered It gives people a chance who normally wouldnt be able to dominant due to lack of necessary skill or just going against weapons that absolutely oppress them I personally play short ranged weapons and it gets tough to approach when you are constantly matched up with mid to longranged weapons when your weapon doesnt have the kit to contend Definitely a plus seeing brush being able to grapple because in certain do or die situations the brush may be the last line of defense and deserves a chance to shine without constantly having to wait until opponents approach you",2.0,926
I cant even This game is going to be so good The added player titles the new music absolutely slaps And the new victory animations and just Everything else,2.0,162
This gameplay is awesome and I am loving the music being played especially now or never it sounds more intense than the other splatoon games really gives off the feeling that it is the last minute of the match and the team that is losing must make a comeback fast,2.0,269
I love the new display and gear The new abilities fit the City of Chaos get up I like how it shows what weapons we should expect to have their specials Cant wait to see if they release a test fire,2.0,203

"Donde anuncien un nuevo Mario en 3D para Switch exploto de la emocin

Y tambin eso dira mucho de Nintendo sobre las intenciones que tienen con Switch por que un Mario 3D usualmente sale a vender nueva consola  por lo que si lanzan un nuevo juego as  me hara pensar a mi que no estn pensando en lanzar una nueva consola en el futuro cercano Muy curioso

Perfectly said Ive been bringing up stuff like this for years and I absolutely despise this double standard You can love their games all you want I certainly do but Nintendo as a company is seriously one of the worst in the industry Stop discounting everything they do just because you have good memories of them This needs to be fixed not just at Nintendo but everywhere,0.0,382
Good stuff man People being inconsistent is the only consistent part of the internet,2.0,86
When I was a kid in the early 90s you could still write a sloppy hand written 4 page letter with crayon drawings and send it to Nintendo of America and they would immediately write you back answering every single question you had no matter how dumb it was and complementing your crappy drawings in detail I think my Dad might still have some of their response letters in his desk Those days are long gone,0.0,408
Youre 100 right Everyone has to decide for themselves how serious this stuff is but at the end of the day theres a lot of virtue signalling going on Also while were at it lets all admit that as much as people like to hate Kotaku at least theyre willing to report this kind of stuff,0.0,293
Heres a hot take Most hardcore gamerstech workers who would in nerd stuff are going to be a bunch of socially awkward weirdos This is why these things happen at all gaming companies and places like Gencon where they virtue signal but these virtue signalers are the ones who commit assault andor harassment ,0.0,314
No new concept was added to my life with this video Maybe it will help someone out there to see companies as companies not friends,1.0,133
Its good to see that youre always willing to speak your mind In a time where anybody that speaks up on anything will be bashed and harassed for being honest The direction things are going in general on speaking out is sad  Appreciate you and your brutal honesty brother  ,2.0,278
I like Nintendo games but not people who commit sexual harassment which happens in too many places Men and women do act in unsolicited ways towards others,0.0,157
Congratulations RGT youre finally learning what trends are It seems Nintendo hasnt trended negatively like Activision has so their opinions havent been altered,2.0,164
I miss the days when you unlocked these things by playing the game at your own pace Characters and stages were always cool rewards for beating the games challenges,2.0,166
Congratulations Nintendo you did it  You added what should have been there in the first place,2.0,96
Thank god the queen of Mario sportsparty games is finally here Daisy deserves better I absolutely love her ,2.0,110
"Daisy should have been there from the first but I am glad to see more than a single character in these updates

2 a stage and gear Its exciting but it also means my expectations were very low",2.0,196
I do really appreciate how new characters still get hand drawn art to match everyone else If all the dlc adds new stages gear and characters then Ill be coming back to this game for a long time,2.0,199
Its about time Daisy came to this game she shouldve been here from the drop I am so hyped,2.0,93
This is a bare minimum update that should have been there day one I want to see MUCH bigger updates in the future,2.0,114
"Id never argue with new content entirely so Im grateful and happy theyve added what they added here I think if the game wants to see a potential sector for longevity it would need to have a Spectator Mode and possibly proper 4v4 Online where all players can be remote so that there could be a tourney scene
I myself would be hosting them regularly with a Spectator Mode client but it could go eSports if they had a tournament scene like that But like I say Im happy for any additional content being added to the game and I hope theyll consider modesfeatures for the updates to come",2.0,597
You guys really need to start releasing your games with full content on release,2.0,80
Good to see them adding in more stadiums too not just characters,2.0,65
I dont know why but its so nice seing people get nice things for themselves ,2.0,76

Very nice,2.0,13
hey  just to let u know at 755 u go to press the power button on the switch to turn it on but u can actually hold the home button on ur joy con to turn ur switch on as well 3 a lot easier especially if ur playing docked hope this helps,2.0,241

What do you think of all of this Will it be in future games Lemme know,1.0,73
Id like to see a 4K docked and 1080p handheld successor to the Switch thats backwards compatible and more powerful with better graphics online and frame rate too,2.0,165
What I need going forward is a Nintendo Switch successor that is backwards compatible and offers improvements to previously released games I need to play Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Torna over again in true 1080p or at 1440p whether it be 30fps or 60fps I just want them to be clear with further and more saturated draw distances and that dynamic resolution removed  Of course this would benefit many other games but I havent NG XC2 because I am hopeful Ill get to reexperience improved on new hardware,2.0,509
I actually feel Nintendo should probably leave their next gen design choice at the Nintendo Switch level Its the perfect system whether you want a home console portable or both They should just focus on upgrading hardware on each gen or giving it refreshes with better design implementations like joycons with pro controller sticks Id also like to see more things the Switch could be paired with like linking to discord and Spotify and having them run in the background,2.0,478
"Graphics do matter but its more tied to the visual style and aesthetics that are implemented I dont care about SUPER REALISTIC graphics I just want stable eyepleasing visuals with amazing gameplay

Look no further than how poorly some of the earlier realistic graphics have aged on previous consoles while games with a more unique art style have remained timeless",1.0,376
Given Nintendos track record with moves that make sense they will use this feature sparingly as they did with cloud gaming and file transfers,1.0,144
"It must be difficult for nintendo to decide on how to move on from the Switch

I would like to see the next console hybrid hopefully support switch cartridges still",1.0,168
I wonder if No Mans Sky coming to Switch in October will incorporate some of this new tech weve been seeing more of Seems like a game like that will need all the help it can get to run smoothly on the Switch Im still really curious to see how it turns out Likely will either be a pretty solid 30FPS or 30FPS with frame drops and low res I suspect the low rest automatically in either case but I never played the game so Im interested to possibly give it a try if its a half decent port,2.0,497
I still love my Switch but after owning the Steam Deck for a couple of weeks I have to say  Valve is doing a substantially better job supporting the Steam Deck then Nintendo is the Switch Ive already got more updates that have made the system even better in a couple weeks then Nintendo has in 5 years Nintendo needs to take a page out of Valves playbook here,2.0,366
Id love to see Monolith apply this tech either FSR 10 or DLSS when the newer model drops in an update to Xenoblade Chronicles 2 All the Xenoblade games are in my evergrowing backlog so I think Ill wait to see if this actually happens ,2.0,242

Ive had my Steam Deck for about a month now and your reaction to the weight was EXACTLY the same reaction I had Everyone says its so big but honestly when you hold it in your hand and feel that weight it makes everything go away Amazing handheld,2.0,252
Personally Id much rather a free carrying case then fancy unnecessary packaging I appreciate a company thats forgo paying the extra bucks on packaging and placing it into something more functional to the consumer in the long run,2.0,232
While I really have no plans to get a Steam Deck Im hoping that a little healthy competition for the Switch will make Nintendo step up their game with the next Switch or with some sort of Pro model like the fans have been crying for for years,1.0,246
The Steam Deck is an excellent friendly competitor Nintendos advantage is many great first Ip and tons of third parties Not to mention name recognition but the stream deck could make Nintendo focus on creating a Nintendo Switch Pro or Nintendo Switch 2 that has more power which I think is great because it puts more pressure on Nintendo to do better,2.0,355
I think fancy premium packaging would be cool but I like the fact that they are trying to be less wasteful in comparison to other businesses,2.0,142
The packaging feels really nice and Valvelike They made it simple and homey if you get me and it feels like a homemade dinner in comparison to the Switches package which would be compared to a fancy restaurant The outside doesnt matter its the inside that matters this couldnt be more true with the Steam Deck,2.0,320
"While the Steam Decks performance handling these AAA games is impressive Id really like to see more content creators focus on other aspects The Steam Deck is a fantastic way for first timers to try PC gaming and it really has so much more to offer
Where I feel it really shines is the extensive catalog of lesser known smaller and past titles
Basically pick any random old game and it will likely allow settings comparable to the rereleaseremaster releases that you have to wait for and pay extra on console Older games often look much better on smaller screens too So many should be fantastic on that little thing",2.0,629
One of my favorite uses for my Steam Deck was loading emudeck and having the virtual console Ive always wished the Switch would be,2.0,132

Youre constantly putting out extremely well curated and delivered content Thank you ,2.0,86
I think Phil is referring to games coming to PC and mobile As for Xbox games it means the same but also where ever game pass is too I seen a lot of PlayStation fanboys acting like Xbox will go 3rd party and all Xbox games will be on PlayStation,1.0,247
Console exclusives arent going anywhere They would be insane to split market share off of their hardware their ecosystem and ultimately their control Nintendo has dominated both Sony and Microsoft this generation with the unreal success of the Switch They are the proof in the pudding that hardware and exclusives are still what drive the consumer towards the platform,2.0,374
"Destin I think I enjoy your content because it pushes rational debates or argument To the issue of exclusives I think the strategy of MS has already been spelled out 

What I think MS plans to do is make the console the foundation of their business strategy They will have console exclusives but they will not restrict their games to just the console device which is Sonys strategy It just means they will release on multiple devices from PCs to TVs to mobile phones and through cloud MS has expanded agreesively

But I personally do not think their games will go to Sony consoles like most people tend to think because Sony are their competition",2.0,661
I think its a time of wait and see Imo were seeing all these investments because interest rates are low If at the end of the process Sony for example dont see financial gain I can easily see it reverting Were all hoping this works as gamers but none of us know what the end result will be,1.0,300
Phil Spencer said the day of the press conference welcoming Bethesda into the fold that it was about making games available on platforms where game pass exist so this is not anything new hes staying consistent,2.0,211
I would love to boot up my console and swap from Battlefield to Halo to Spiderman to Mario Kart to Pokmon within the same ecosystem but I just dont think something like that will happen unless there is a third party neutral console that has all the subscriptions for each major player on it,1.0,292

What do you think about the FUTURE of console EXCLUSIVES Thanks for watching and LIKING the video 3,2.0,102
What would be the point in multiple consoles if they are all the same then  We might as well have a one console nation   No competition or reasons to buy different consoles   Exclusives give each console an identity and reasons to invest into a particular console  Theres a reason Netflix has different movies from HBO Max,1.0,328
I believe most exclusives will be timed exclusives Companies like Nintendo will never ever have their first party titles on other platforms,1.0,141
Xbox says game pass is the future Because we have itthen exclusives are doomed because we have less than none,0.0,118
"I disagree Console exclusives is what separates the companies and hardware apart If exclusive games are a thing of the past then their is no need for a PlayStation Xbox or Switch Everyone will become a PC gamer 

In a perfect world Sony Microsoft  Nintendo will join forces and Sony will engineer the hardware with Microsofts wallet and ambition for higher specs and Nintendos passion for innovation Unfortunately we dont live in such a world",1.0,455

"I have had a love hate relationship with console exclusives I get why they exist and why they draw consumers to a specific platform This coming Phil along Xboxs track record concerning their exclusives since around 2013 and up havent exactly been praised as PlayStations have been this is more corporate weasel words 

Xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises Halo Gears of War umIm sure Im forgetting some others The line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption 

Xbox has doing really well with Game Pass but they are missing that killer app for the system",0.0,689

PINNED COMMENT  This video took a little while to put together Sorry for the delay but let me know what your favorite reveal was at Gamescom 2022,1.0,148
Apart from Lies of P and Calisto Protocol i really found Atlas Fallen to be really interesting surprised no one is talking about this new game reveal Also absolutely thrilled to learn that Lies of P will release day 1 on Game Pass one of the few benefits of owning both Consoles that you get to enjoy the best of both worlds,2.0,331
Lies of P looks incredible also Dead island looks like it could be good High on life looks very fun it was a good showcase lots of game but also lots of ads,2.0,157
This was a very solid Gamescom especially loved the bit of trolling we got from Kojima Seems like this event just keeps getting better every year,2.0,147
"Favorite reveal was gameplay of Lies of P coming to gamepass day 1

Yes looks and feels like its gonna be awesome

Definitely playing it but yea 2023 is stacked",2.0,164
I knew something was missing out of my daily life Thanks for the vids Jay Your work and content is so underrated,2.0,115
Atlas Fallen The Lords Of The Fallen and Lies of P were my favorite take aways from the show Well Where Winds Meet too but Im hesitant since I dont know if it will release on Xbox or not,1.0,192
High On Life is Conker but as a first person shooter Im hyped for that game Lies of P is the successor of Bloodborne Callisto Protocol looking good Sonic Frontiers Im impressed Atlas Fallen and Dead Island 2 oh yea ,2.0,223
Pretty good show overall cant wait for lies of P man ,2.0,54
I agree that the show was average but the Dead Island 2 reveal made my day Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide are the most addictive zombie games I have played I played both of them all the way to the end,2.0,209
Thanks for watching What consoles do you currently own,2.0,56
Just bought the series S It looks great loads fast and plays next gen games Ill upgrade in a couple years when the series X is easier to find Its worth it people,2.0,167
Series s is PERFECT for PlayStation players who want to expand their gaming library After getting my ps5 I wanted a cheap way into the Xbox ecosystem and this has been an amazing console that I honestly grew to appreciate more than the ps5 due to the small size and price,2.0,272
The deal breaker for me is not having a disc drive when Ive amassed a huge collection of physical discs Thats why I got the Series X However for anyone new to Xbox or someone who doesnt own physical discs this is a great purchase,2.0,237
Ive owned both and the Series S has a special place in my heart I love the X but unless youre rocking a TV that supports 4K120 w VRR the Series S is just fine Also its SO tiny and its amazing what a quiet beast it is But definitely buy the storage expansion card regardless of which one you buy,2.0,306
The Series S is plain amazing especially with GamePass and if you are into backward compatibility gaming Ive just completed the entire Gears series on 360 because I never got to play them back in the day Gears 1 to Judgment and its been a pure blast You can also find an online list of all the games who received an FPS boost including Xbox and Xbox 360 games so theres that too Some are now locked at 60 and some are even at 120 FPS Yes my last name is Spencer how did you know,2.0,491
The only next gen console I could find was this one Have owned it for about a year 0 regrets Would buy it again Its amazing Its form factor blows my mind So tiny but so powerful,2.0,183
I definitely have no complaints with the Series S From what Ive seen 1440 is still more than adequate for graphics and it runs super smooth and is still a very quick console,2.0,176
"I was totally blown away by my series s 
I still cant believe what you can get there for 300 bucks
Still I upgraded to series x because Im used to pc quality and the extra fps and native resolution is totally worth investing the extra money 
Still I would totally go for the series s 
Its super quiet performance is mind blowing And its pretty small 
I guess this time Xbox is superior to PlayStation even though everybody is freaking out about ps5 and is probably sleeping on the new Xbox consoles though theyre way better 
X is more powerful and the s is a absolute price performance killer 

I didnt expect to be that happy with Xbox after being used to a high end pc",2.0,677
needless to say that the Series S is actually easy to find and purchase while getting a Series X for not more than original retail price is difficult,2.0,150
Xbox just announced the Xbox Series S as a suprise so unfortunately its missing in this video The price is also announced 499 for the Xbox Series X and 299 for the Xbox Series S What do you think will you buy the Series X or S,1.0,235

For my personal budget I grabbed an Xbox series x primarily because of game pass which has been an amazing experience  Hopefully after tax season Ill be able to find a ps5  The Sony exclusives are the one thing that Im missing on my Xbox but having both of them along with the switch would be a harmony of mathematical precision lol I think all consoles are wonderful in their perspective but together its gamers paradise ,2.0,428
Im a fan of gaming not a fan of a specific company I enjoy both systems,2.0,75
My 1st console was the original PS  Loved it so much that I stayed with them and upgraded to PS2  Somewhere in there I picked up a used xbox because my 1st Lan party with Halo just blew me away  Then 3rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what I was willing to spend at that time so I turned to Nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems  Getting the Xbox series X was an easy decision for me  I have Nintendo Switch for my exclusives strategy and rpg needs while the Xbox satisfied my craving for FPS and games that required higher processing and graphical power,2.0,617
Honestly for most people it comes to whatever your friends have,1.0,63
I like them both like they both have great exclusives and great hardware and stunning traffics where it is hard to tell the difference between reality and non reality they both are amazing systems,2.0,196
You quickly mentioned that online depends on where our friends also play  That is a win for the Xbox because it has direct integration with PC  You can chat with anyone on PC but also directly play with them in a slew of GamePass games that silently support crossplay between PC and Xbox  Playstation is doubling down on the walledgarden approach to keep people buying their brand through sunken cost and social ostricization perpetuating the console wars really  No brainer Microsoft is the one doing far better on supporting multiple platforms and opening the experinece to a larger audience including online,2.0,624

I was once in line at a GameStop to buy a used PS3 when a guy got in line behind me to trade in his PS3 So i bought the PS3 off the guy for less then what GameStop was selling them and more then what he would have received from the store We both won on that day,2.0,264
As someone I used to work for GameStop my advice is to always buy the Used system over the Refurbished ones The refurbished ones were broken at one point and whoever fixes them doesnt do a great job,0.0,203
I was a manager at Electronics Boutique 20 years ago and we had the same problem with the PS2 company refurbs and they usually didnt operate I told my staff to unpack them when they came in immediately mark them as defective and ship them back out We had gotten burned too many times and I wasnt gonna put my customers through that anymore,0.0,348
I sold my Xbox One X a few months ago on eBay and whew this video makes it seem like I really sold mine for far far too cheap  Im one of those people that keeps everything  including the foam wrap plastic bags and twist ties  so the console looks pretty darn good once I get it all back together  I can imagine that the only reason youd want to buy from Gamestop is just the ease if something is wrong and familiarity  Also they dont know me but they know Gamestop,2.0,487
I worked at GameStop for 5 years and that is by far one of the most unacceptable packing jobs Ive seen The first console you opened was likely in terrible shape when it was traded in its common for those refurbished ones to have panels replaced or be opened up and fixed from the inside out I bet its missing the rubber pieces on the bottom because its been resurfaced in some way The second console was likely just a trade in tested by an employee for under 5 minutes With these consoles very little is done before theyre repackaged and sold,0.0,554
Something to keep in mind i had to replace the thermal past and pads because the home screens of most games were enough to make it over heat and power off,1.0,154
I used to work in a used game store We would refurbish GameStop refurbished consoles literally daily from people who had them for just a little over a month GameStop refurbishes are known for taking shortcuts at every possible turn and using the cheapest replacement parts available We had a local GameStop that was notorious for ignoring thermal paste on literally everything they did So much so we put out a social media post letting everyone in our area know we would redo the thermal paste in any GameStop console they purchased within a week with proof for 10 Fuck GameStop,1.0,586
I used to work at gamestop and I can say they didnt give us enough packing supplies to ship out orders,0.0,103
I work at GameStop and we arent supposed to package it like that The price is high cause we are low supply of consoles but everything else is pretty accurate ahaha,1.0,167
FYI for those of us who miss out on a sale by a few daysif an item goes on sale a few days after you bought it just call up customer service and politely ask for a partial refund Gamestop is usually pretty good about giving you the difference in cost between what you paid and the current price of the console,1.0,316

Gamepass is such an amazing servicei mean at first it was ok but NOW and next year WOWCant wait for all these games to release day one,2.0,140
The reason they said large and open space instead of largest map is because if you look at their past games and you measure the square footages of every location and put them together that may be bigger None of their past games have had an open world Their other games usually have one big world segmented into multiple locations In this game its actually one open world so its the largest open space of any game they created And they did say that this open world is bigger than Prey,1.0,490
There is no loop hole for how Death Stranding made it to Game Pass PC As some have already commented 505 owns the PC rights so theyre free to put it on anything they want Sony owns the console rights to DS so this is why it will probably never come to Xbox consoles unfortunately,0.0,289

Well we do have some really bad ass games on game pass already and if they aint planning any new additions this yr we should be good honestly its not a big deal for me personally  I run both xbox series S and X which honestly its been more series S than the X And ps5 so Im good on games lol  dude I have thousands of games already on both platforms  So yea and atm Im back on forza horizon 4 and 5 and elden ring and dark souls 3 and demon souls remake So Ill be busy for a while so if they wanna sort things out for us on GP Im ok and Im sure many of us are xbox has been really good to us ya know They take a huge hit just for us to have fun and thats why I love xbox They truly try to help us out with lowering the prices of the series S and X and keeping game pass cheap and keeping a ton of games on it Yeah games on Xbox store is higher than picking up the disk for ps4 n ps5 ect but still they do good by us with Game pass n the cheap as hell monthly bill and the already low price of the series S n X  and i dont understand why ppl are shit talking the Series S dude I love mine I have 3 of em    And it can do 4k Microsoft already said it does lmao and all ya gotta do is when you plug it up to your TV go to settings display settings and select 4k 60hz or 4k 120hz what ever your TV or monitor does and then start a Game and then take the TV remote and hit the OK button your TV will tell you what the series S is putting out to it mine shows 4k 60hz Hdr10 DD and the games look beautiful and smooth yeah its not as nice as the series X but its Def not 1080P its a higher resolution 100 and I dont see how someone can get 1080p by looking at it lol 1080p dont look that damn sharp n good lmao and just look at the ps4 pro specs the ps4 pro is a 4k correct well the series S has better specs has better hardware the same or a Lil more Tflops as well the series is is a Zen 2 which is a AMD 3k series a RTX machine it will do 4k just not as well as its bigger brother the X,2.0,2057

I few years back I did a repair on a computer with a broken SATA port  i replaced the port and the system ran fine  A year and a half later the same customer comes in saying that his data storage hard drive wasnt working  Im like okay  I asked did he want data recover service  He said it was working fine and that I was the last person to touch the computer so it must have been something Id done  I keep snap shots of before and after repairs of my work and keep a printout with all my work orders  I said to him that his system didnt even have an HDD in it when it was repaired and only had one SSD in it  He mumbled something and said hed just take his business elsewhere

I know the vast majority of people reading this are either in the electronics repair business or are hobbyists  But I have a serious question to people whod just be regular customers  If you had something repaired a year or more ago and something else went wrong unrelated to the original problem would you seriously bring it back to the repair shop expecting that it would get fixed for free  Im hoping this question doesnt come out as snarky or sarcastic  Its a sincere question Id like to have answered",1.0,1231

The NES SNES and N64 had no builtin startup but most official Nintendo games would add those in if you inserted a cartridge The spinning N that made the N64 famous would differ between games for example and was sometimes differently and even wrongly colored Furthermore the GB and GBC also had a startup that you didnt inlcude and the DSi system had a different startup from the original Lastly the GameCube had a 3rd startup version where the soundbites would change to Japanese chanting and shamisens but it would only fire if you pressed the Zbutton on 4 connected controllers at the same time,1.0,612

Gaz is spot on in regards to Xbox marketing It is an Xbox problem and their marketing in many european countries is either nonexistent or incredibly limited They have a good product with a good service and software yet in many europeans markets they are being outsold 101 because they either dont know how or where to market their product or their budget is super limited,0.0,379

Hey guys love your work I went to preorder Modern Warfare 2 from the Xbox store yesterday and was quite surprised to find that its priced at 6995  have you covered this I think it may be the first 70 Xbox game Ive come across,2.0,237
"When a game says their new game is bigger than their last game The people whining saying A bigger map means the game wont be dense Are just complaining to complain They do not know shit if the game is more dense or not That is just a deflection of an actual reaction or thought with any real substance 
I guess I am just sick of these people who are sick of studios being proud of making their games bigger than their previous If the game is not out or being played by reviewers at least Then lets just be patient and wait until we are playing it instead of saying some BS comments are are being made up out of complete guesses pretty much 

I truly like how Gaz does not hold back on any side PlayStation or Xbox N will tell it how it is that is refreshing But him bitching about the Red Fall map when he didnt even watch the new 21 minute video the studio put out Plus their was some new shit being show So I dont even know what Colt was complaining about that Arkane did not show anything new in the video when they had the chance to or whatever he was saying",0.0,1081

I think in the future the value of having the series x will grow exponentially when you look at the number of studios Microsoft has been acquiring and with fewer cross gen titles limiting Devs from using the full power of the next gen consoles,2.0,246
Im very happy with my Series S and Ive been all about physical media before I got it I do plan on getting a series X eventually but Ive just been playing digital games on my Xbox One most of the time because of Game Pass Ultimate After thinking about it I realized my physical library on Xbone was substantially smaller than my PS4 library or Switch library so I didnt really feel bad about getting the Series S and an external hard drive Even though my 360 library was pretty big Ive been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like 3 each digitally When the Series X becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper Ill get one but for now Im really enjoying my Series S,2.0,697
As someone on a budget the series s is great game pass makes it really great especially with the deals u can get and just using external hard drives are a better option because transferring games is better than paying half the price of the console for the ssd so yeah if u have more money maybe get the series x but it just depends on ur situation,2.0,347
"I have a decent amount of physical games from the original Xbox 360 and one so I feel justified getting the Series X especially because it has superior fps at 4K resolution The problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series X to its limits yet If you still have a one X and plan to get a Series X later and can wait you can update the Internal HDD to a SDD on the One X Itll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the Series S The One X has a better graphics card than the series S previous games optimized for the One X will look better on the One X than on the series S However cross platform games are probably going to have a better FPS than the X do to the better CPU Theres a lot that goes into this stuff 

Another factor to consider is the quality of your tv Ill be looking to pair my Series X with a new OLED tv here soon and then Im 200 sure Ill feel justified with the purchase

Also I game a lot so 30 60 120 frames a second I notice the difference And in no way shape or form would I feel justified having a next gen console Series S that cant even keep up with my old 4K tv",2.0,1182
It really depends on what your main platform is If your main is Playstation Ive seen a lot go with the Series S to get the exclusives Most that main a PS5 dont want to pay the extra,1.0,187
Thank you for sharing your experience with these consoles and not fan boying Speaking your truth will help alot of people who are on a budget People constantly spread the narrative of digital games are horrible but why when the majority of the world doesnt but movies or music Im all for digital downloads and will only purchase physical games if its attached to a special edition that Im truly a fan of,2.0,412
In your own words Do I really want an XBOX No Do I really need an XBOX No But I feel like I work hard and I deserve it In reality since the day you stepped onto the XBOX Series platform you have been trying to convince yourself that you need something you didnt really want thats foolish logic The next time you dont want something dont buy it because you think you work hard and deserve it,0.0,408
"I dont have a Series X yet and although Series S is a great console the fact is all digital is a no go for me The reason is that I have a good collection of XBOX 360 and XBOX One physical games and some of them such as older Forza Horizon or Forza Motorsport games are not available to buy digitally anymore due to  license issues So the only way of playing those games is using the disc I would be happy with a Series So with disc drive but as this is not an option Ill have to go with the Series X
Another point is that although GamePass is great I had it for two years and experienced great games including Halo Infinite I think it is a bit too expensive If it was 80 per year as the Live Gold was it would be a no brainer but at 15 per month 180 per year I think it is too expensive You can use that money and buy over 7 AAA games on physical or digital sale for that price assuming an average cost of 25 per game",1.0,948
I bought a Series S when it first came out and a 3 year gamepass subscription Was pretty impressed with the little beast but soon ran into the lack of free space to install games  So I decided to sell the S and buy the Series X Had the X now for a year  but the other day I suddenly realised that I hadnt turned on my series X for a week And before that it was just sporadically So decided to sell  BUT  I didnt want to completely move away from gaming and I managed to find an absolute awesome deal on a Series S  140 euros with 2 controllers and 1 of those controllers is the 20th anniversary edition  Going to sell that  which will make my Series S end price probably around 60 euros Cant get better than that  For casual gamers like myself  the Series S is a fantastic console,2.0,799
Big mistake  I own both the X Box Series X and PS 5 and alot of the older games from previous gen releases run and look alot better on the X Box Series X  Even some of the current gen titles look better on X Box Series X  Also Microsofts recent buy outs with Bethesda Activision and potentially other gaming software companies means future releases like COD and Skyrim releases may be X Box Series X exclusives,2.0,417
Got my Series X on Friday and Im really impressed with it The visuals are jaw dropping,2.0,90
I went from a One S to the Series X and the jump to 4K 60fps is pretty significant everything feels much smoother and everything loads faster thank god for SSDs The only issue is that there arent really any games out right now designed specifically for the Series X with the exception of the medium aha,2.0,307
Ive been a lifelong PlayStation fan but after looking at the beauty and power of the new Series X I just may get one  Im enjoying the PS5 too,2.0,148
As a huge PlayStation fan That packaging is another level ,2.0,59
Ive had my series X for a week and Im still in love with it the visuals and overall gameplay of the games are amazing I cant stop playing Microsoft flight sim because of how beautiful it looks and how well the console runs the game Strongly recommend if your an Xbox fan,2.0,276
Great job here Man that is so beautifully lit filmed and cut It looks literally perfect Would you ever consider making some tips how to film like that Re the Series X its such a shame supply sucks Ive been lucky enough to source one but its such a wonderful machine that should be in so many more houses,2.0,316

As a Playstation fan I really hope the deal goes through Theyve relied on cod marketing to boost their sales since the beginning of the last gen Sony will have to innovate and become more attractive in other more interesting things than COD,2.0,244
This is ridiculous does Sony not understand the deal is going through no matter what its business PlayStation does it all the time,0.0,131
I personally like that Xbox is being so aggressive I got tired of them playing nice a long time ago especially considering that Sony has never extended to them the same courtesy,0.0,180
The part at 500 explains it clearly this is why I have such a huge problem with Sony right now The sense of entitlement and pettiness coming from them is infuriating Seems like this is all about gamepass and other moves by MS changing the industry and now Sony is upset because they have to compete on more even ground and are resentful about it,0.0,351
thats the console war we need This kind of competition gets the best out of both companies and it means Ws for all of us consumers,2.0,133
I primary  play on PS but recently got back into Xbox for the first time since Xbox 360 so Im happy to see Xbox actually do well because it pushes Sony to do better  When I see twitter I see so much venom from both sides and its super sad to see i just love video games man why cant we just enjoy it,2.0,305
I have both PlayStation and Xbox and I like how this competitive climate is forcing change on both sides Microsoft was foundering during the last generation so they introduced Game Pass which forced Sony to step up their game with PS Plus Competition ultimately benefits the consumer Things are getting spicy with these acquisitions but being on both platforms Im content to let them duke it out for my money,2.0,418
Boy that escalated quickly I mean that really got out of hand fast  Ron Burgundy,0.0,86

Almost every industry is going subscription based why wouldnt gaming Its going to happen and at least Microsoft is at the helm and doing it right I feel completely respected as a consumer and it seems to me to be healthy for gaming,2.0,238

I think once developers start to use velocity architecture mesh shaders direct storage FSR20 VRS20 the full toolset then we will see some amazing results from this little beaut especially as the biggest issue is lack or RAM which with direct storage n velocity they will able to use the SSD as a Virtual RAM pool the console has a lot of potential but depends if the developers use the toolset available to them when the features become available especially as we know the GDK is New for this gen and a lot of features are still being developed and improved upon,2.0,573
Comparing the Switch and the Series S is a good way to explain what it is Both have a more accessible price but the difference is that Series S has a lot more power and features but cannot be used portable in a convenient way It depends what you needwant at that price point,1.0,278
I think the implementation of FSR 20 and the evolution of upscaling technologies will enable the Series S to stay relevant  The third pearly thing is a concert but I think its more of a problem with games made for the previous systems ie Ace Combat 7,1.0,254
"I think for the price I got mine used for 180 euros paired with a nice 24 1080p IPS monitor the Series S is very good value As you said I have found Forza FSX and Halo to run great To your point regarding storage space I also agree that just having space for the couple of games you are currently playing is perfect On previous Xbox consoles I would find Id fill up the HDD with loads of games due to Game Pass and a few other purchases and never got time to play them properly

Oh lets not forget the Series S is a fantastic emulation box more than capable of running many consoles",2.0,592
I have a PC with a 3060 in it I have a Nintendo Switch and I have a Series S i have never had an issue with how the Series S runs games because my xbox is mostly for game pass and games that run perfectly fine on the console like NBA 2k Optimizations for new console generations take quite some time and Im patient and it is not a new issue The PS4 had its issues the xbox one x had its issues they were fixed people complaining should calm down,2.0,460

I bought my series S on 21st jul 2022 its my first console ever and been almost a month since i got it I absolutely love it idk why i see people complaining about the resolution I got it plugged in on my 4K 55 TV and boy games look amazing I have been playing Halo infinite Forza horizon 5 FiFA 22 Hades two point campus Ori and the wisp  turbo golf racing and after all these games i still have around 143 gb left so no complaints about storage either I am totally enjoying it,2.0,495
I absolutely love the portability of the series s,2.0,50
"These next gen consoles shouldve shipped with more storage to begin with especially considering theyre backwards compatible with last gen But atleast Xbox lets you connect more then 1 storage device

If you dont mind moving games Id suggest getting an ultra small flashdrive like the Sandisk Ultra Fit You can easily fit 2 on the back USB ports on the Xbox giving up to 1TB of more storage While still having room the expandable SDD too Plus you can play the older Xbox One games off the flashdrive

Sure you can do the same thing with a normal harddrive However using an ultra small flashdrive takes up no extra space Meaning its easier to fit in an entertainment center Plus it makes it easier if you move your console often",2.0,746

Lets look at this from a consumer point of view paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing No big deal thats just how the business is Obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console But for Sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially BRIBE multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay FULL price on there platform instead because they know they cant compete with it is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get And they have the NERVE to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black  Sony has no answer to gamepass there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they cant go anywhere else This is simply Sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from COD But I guarantee if Sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldnt leave COD multiplatform Its apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for Sony  hypocrisy at its best,0.0,1265

Pretty scummy on Sonys part on this one The game wars are always fair game tactics until you do practices that deliberately sabotage the competition MS doesnt need the console exclusivity as Game Pass is on PC as well so they just want those subsriptions,0.0,259

I understand if you pay for Exclusive games on your platform then it should not be on your competitor subscription service But blocking 3rd party multi platform games is shitty,0.0,178
I didnt even know gamepass had more potential until I learned that they are preventing it from having a lot of games ugh it used to be ridiculous to think that dvd blue ray would stop being a thing when videos went to Netflix Hulu and etc but I think thats the future of social media anyways just my opinion,0.0,309
IMO whats most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly theyre hoping to get out of these deals Everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money But then what I have to wonder is if Gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios then why wouldnt they turn down PS In theory Gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties Weve also seen plenty of evidence that Xbox is swimming in Microsoft money so they should easily have the means to outbid Sony for games they want on their service as well as typical console exclusives for that matter Yet we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to Sonys deals and stipulations If a studio wanted to join GP and told Sony they would decline their GP restriction contract I can see them getting less marketing on PS but I highly doubt Sony wouldnt want their sales Cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with Sony but I dont know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line It just seems to me like somehow many studios arent jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on Gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it That or GP isnt as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think No shade at GP I love it just saying I dont get how MS would be losing out to Sonys contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place,2.0,1751

My favorite xbox series accessorie is the PDP Media Remote Ive had it for about 6 months and its great especially for the price Got it for 10 on sale on amazon and they are i think 20 or 25 now Worth every penny unlike the series 2 i bought Its a great controller as well scince they have fixed some of the reliability issues in the newer ones however the price is still to much If your lucky like i was you can find one refurbished for 150 if thats a risk your willing to take buying refurbished,2.0,506

to be honest unless you have a TV that can do 4k 120hz theres no point thinking about the future Pro versions 4k 60hz doesnt push the Series X so no point upgrading if you dont have a top of the line TV,1.0,210
I really wish they would beef up the storage on the S for its current price A 1tb XBOX X is the same price as an S with a 1tb expansion makes it way less appealing Granted you end up with a little more storage that way but also less capability in the S Overall I feel if it wasnt for the whole world collectively crapping itself over the last couple yrs last gen would have already been put out to pasture As it stands theres not enough current gen owners to pull that trigger yet so games have this half in half out feel Hopefully production ramps up for PS and XBOX so we can leave last gen behind,0.0,609
I see a lot of comments from people upset about next gen games not really happening yetwe cant really blame Microsoft for that though We have to look at the devs and ask them why theyre continuing to support older hardware instead of trying to focus on the newer ones Most likely to due with the limited availability the last couple of years but still Now is the time they should be focusing on Series SX,1.0,413
I would say that the best thing about the XBox2 AKA Series SX are the memory cards  Theyre convenient  swappable  With the size that AAA  even some AA games are coming at these days I view them as essential  With the PS5 Id have to get at a bare minimum a 2 TB which ISNT swappable,2.0,295
If we could just get support for older games to run at higher frame rates and resolutions that would be amazing,2.0,112
Its pretty ridiculous that Microsoft is looking towards upgrading systems especially with it being hard to get the new consoles now Neither company should be focused on Pro consoles until the Series X and PS5 have been out and have reached their full potential,0.0,263

I feel you on the cost of the pro series controller I have one of the series 1 pro controllers which I bought used and frankly I was disappointed that after I had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel I had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there because Xbox doesnt offer their own replacement parts which I find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue To be honest I would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isnt going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time The paddles are nice and all but I can buy like 3 games for the cost or I can buy a third party controller from SCRUB for less and get the same functionality out of it But hey to each their own What I would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab I would pay extra for that but as it stands right now Ill stick with my standard series X controller ,0.0,1071
"Im beginning to lean more and more towards the opinion that the Initiative was always going to be partnering up with a bigger more experienced studio from the getgo Maybe they had plans to do this originally with Certain Affinity as its been confirmed that massive support studio was working with the Initiative from the earliest days most likely on a prototype

But it looks like Gallagher went with his old studio Crystal Dynamics and this was the final straw that caused the schism with a number of the earlier Initiative hires But is it really that surprising The Initiative wasnt hiring hundreds of devs every year to scale up for a massive AAA project they were hiring like a dozen employees per year instead And even Jeff Grubb once succinctly put it Perfect Dark was never going to be made by the Initiative

Pretty sure Gallagher and other highups knew if they were going to make an AAA game they were always going to need a large  experienced studio to take on most of the workload Trying to get that done with a 6575 person team isnt realistic",1.0,1085
If an Elite Series 3 controller is on the horizon Microsoft really needs to focus on quality control I went through 3 Series 2 controllers before giving up and getting a refund I experienced faulty paddles loose buzzing rumble motors and worst of all large deadzones on the analog sticks I really wanted to love it but I couldnt warrant spending that kind of money on a controller with basic functionality issues,0.0,420

but i also remember microsoft being at first very oppositional to the idea of the free to repair thing but shortly after that they were called in again and microsoft had completely reversed their decision so if a third party repairservice was able to repair anything to my series 1 controller as its been a while since i bought it id be all in favor of it that would just secure the longevity of any controller basically for the foreseeable future and im glad microsoft and xbox is supporting that ",1.0,836

The One X is still a very relevant console as it does Native 4K on many games even if it is a stable 30fps And even some at 60fps mostly MS titles Digital Foundry even said graphical differences are very miniscule and for the most part it would take a magnifying glass to spot the differences Which is true since Ive compared both side by side When they get MUST HAVE next gen titles ONLY itll probably be worth it As of now the One XAND Pro are just fine On a 4K display,2.0,486

I own a series S Bought it when the X was impossible to find last year and honestly it runs great Yet to see how next gen gaming truly performs on this thing but I havent had a single issue with the machine Load times are waaayy faster than the xbox one s and PS4 Looks great on my 1440p monitor and when upscaling on 4k tvs Gamepass is great The hard drive is a bit small for holding sx optimized games I use an external for everything else Stick to performance mode and you will not have any frame rate issues Lastly it fits in my backpack if I travel with it This thing is worth every penny imo,2.0,612
More like a 510 performance boost which will allow to push the console just a lil more which could make a world of difference for the series s,2.0,146
More ram being allocated to game devs is nice but it doesnt solve one of the biggest issues of the Series S which is the bandwidth of the memory itself Also more ram doesnt really mean higher frame rates but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see LOD culling It isnt going to affect frame rate by going from 30 to 60 but it might allow a stuttering inconsistent 30 FPS to hold a more locked 30 FPS,0.0,442
I hope they continue to get more put of it in the future as well We need to finally leave last gen development behind and focus on the Series S as the base for optimization going forward Its the perfect 1440p console and it pairs perfectly with 1440p monitors at the moment due to 1440p scaling at launch and a decent internal upscale for older content when displayed on a 1440p monitor You cant touch the value at this price point,2.0,437
ABOUT SFS SAMPLER FEEDBACK STREAMING The demo starting at the 50 second mark was configured to run in 4K and each object is a 16k x 16k BC7 texture Ordinarily this would take up 350MB of GPU memory for each individual object The demo features 985 such objects which would take up nearly 300 GB yes thats GB not MB of GPU memory However as can be seen in the video allocated VRAM usage is just over 3 GB and dedicated VRAM usage is just over 2 GB SFS allows for visuals that simply would not otherwise be possible due to memory constraints,1.0,556

Im a huge marvel fan cant wait to see each project This was wonderfully done and beautifully narrated I was hoping other people were feeling this too its bizarre,2.0,170
"As an Asian who was actually born and brought up in Asia I had never felt issues watching Western shows and their flawed representation I mean if I want to watch a local movie I would just watch one from my own country as there is no way Americans can portray my country and my people better than ourselves This is until I am being lectured about how representation works and how happy I should be watching Americans try to act in various races that totally misrepresented them I mean seriously you are telling me your representation of Chinese is representing all the worlds Chinese That is patronizing as hell because I can tell you there are so many differences between American Chinese China Chinese and other Chinese living in different parts of the world Crazy Rich Asians just made me cringe so hard yes I am from Singapore

I believe No Way Home would be the last good MCU movie for a long time ever if not forever Tried to watch Dr Strange 2 but felt like they killed the original Dr Strange and replaced him with a fake

If you want a good representation movie in recent times Try Everything Everywhere All At Once Great representative movie not because they checked the boxes but their background is actually part of the story showing the struggles the characters experienced due to their background plus the conflict between their cultural background and their current life  I mean they even represented rocks who else can top it",0.0,1468
"When End Game was on the horizon I remember being legitimately scared that the writers would make Captain Marvel kill Thanos and single handedly stop his army So thankful they still knew how to write satisfying character arcs for the finale of my favorite franchise The MCU ended with Endgame and everything since has just been put on the sacrificial alter of Phase 4 feminism

Though Spider Man NWH was just a oneoff great movie for me since Tobeys spidey was the first movie I remember seeing in theaters",2.0,513
It sucks how theyve treated the characters we love so much with such disrespect and replaced them with toxic characters  Spiderman is one of my favorite heroes in marvel and honestly like you said these new characters lack any character growth and as such I dont feel emotionally attached to them or find them even a little bit relatable or likeable I just dont care about these new movies or shows featuring these toxic characters Also I just discovered your channel and I love your content ,0.0,500

"She Hulk im better at controlling my anger because I control my anger infinitely more than you  I control my anger when im catcalled in the street and when toxic men explain my job to me 

Do the writers even know Bruce Banner at all Or do they just look at him as a man that gets angry and turns green and big Because that line of dialogue was ridiculous  Bruce banner was abused as a kid watched his father figure beat his mom to death  Bruce tried to off himself and failed  Bruce has to live with the fact that Hulk took control of his body and mass killed innocent people in Avengers 2  

Absolute ridiculous writing",0.0,635
She Hulk comics were hands down some of the funniest comics I read as a kid Decent action but mostly hilarious If this is half as funny theyll have a winner,2.0,161
"Hulk has fought aliens monsters been sent into space been in battles taken on Thanos forced into hiding had a split personality and has been hunted and attacked by the military

But SheHulk was sort of cat called by three guys outside a bar and her boss did some mansplaining early in the episode  So her life is in her words infinitely more stressful than real Hulk

This show is making feminism seem more ridiculous not less  Also Smart Hulk sucks

Un crossover entre DC y Marvel es prematuro sin que antes DC tenga pilares slidos  Y con pilares slidos me refiero a afianzar los personajes principales personajes y no un Black Adam que NO es un villano ni un hroe sino todo lo contrariono es uno de ellos ni tan siquiera se parece a su contrapartida del cmic ,1.0,328

Si hay una pelcula Marvel vs DC me gustara que fuese animada,1.0,63
Segn yo lo veo en Eternals Marvel fue la primera en guiarle un ojo a DC para alguna probable pelcula conjunta el problema que yo veo es que evidentemente ambas compaas querrn un 50 de participacin y beneficios en todo y el mundo compartido de DC ni por asomo esta lo suficientemente consolidado como para que le d a DC la necesaria fuerza de negociacin para el proyecto,1.0,381

1343  Secret Invasion footage begins with a shot of a field as a beam of light opens along the horizon and a silhouetted figure resembling a classic grey alien emerges As the figure gets closer it takes on a less and less abstract shape until we see it is in fact Nick Fury looking pretty grizzled after his time in space Maria Hill meets with Fury at a bar She tells him that shes been unsuccessfully trying to reach him for years Maria asks why after all this time he decided to come back This is different he says 

In a montage we get quick glimpses of Talos encountering a group of evil Skulls Emilia Clarke shooting a gun Kingsley BenAdir multiplying into several identical forms in a confrontation with Fury and Olivia Colman talking to Nick Fury saying Youre in no shape for this Fury We also see Rhodey being questioned about his security detail and a shot of Martin Freeman as Agent Everett K Ross The trailer ends with Talos asking what the Skulls want from Nick Fury and Fury declaring Im the last person standing between them and what they really want


1918  AntMan Quantumania footage opens at City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco where Scott Lang is reading an excerpt from his new memoir titled Look Out For The Little Guy to an enraptured crowd including a beaming little kid dressed in AntMan cosplay He explains that he is still on call if the Avengers need him but that his main priority in life is taking care of his daughter Cassie As he finishes the chapter and the crowd applauds Scotts phone rings and the caller ID tells him that its the SFPD leading him to remark aloud Why is jail calling

After Scott bails his daughter Cassie Lang out of jail they are seen eating dinner with the Pymvan Dynes Hope Hank and Janet Scott explains that he knows she is just trying to help and when Cassie says that she is trying to do something that matters her dad reminds her that he literally saved the world This comment receives fake shock from everyone else who sarcastically note that he has never mentioned that fact before and Janet tells him that he should write a book about it Shrugging it off the Avenger retorts Youre all welcome for all not being dust

Voice over narration from Kang The Conqueror begins Youre an interesting man Scott Lang Youve lost a lot of time But time isnt what you think Its not a straight line This dialogue is played as the heroes stand in a lab around some kind of device which unexpectedly turns on As it powers up it emits a bright blue light that sends out an energy wave and Cassie gets sucked inside of it As Scott Lang panics and tries to grab her he too is pulled inside the light along with the rest of the main cast landing them in the Quantum Realm 

In montage footage The characters wander through a trippy scifi landscape where they run into Bill Murray who is wearing a kind of fantasy robe He seems to recognize Janet van Dyne We also get a glimpse of MODOK Kangs voiceover continues explaining that he knows how everything in Scotts life ends Scott responds I dont know who you are but youve made a big mistake Im an Avenger  The footage ends with Kang stepping out of the shadows Youre an Avenger Have I killed you before

In a montage set to Do You Realize by Flaming Lips we see the Guardians in colorful spacesuits leaping into space the evil monster from the beginning of the last film Peter and the team getting off in what looks like an Earth neighborhood Nebula is helping to put up a sign in what appears to be a business district with alien writing Theres a flashback to a baby version of Rocket Raccoon We get a look at Will Poulters Adam Warlock who has gold skin Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary and Cosmo the psychic Russian space dog played by Borats Maria Bakalova Groot fights back to back with Quill now fully grown and even more bulky muscular and tall than in the original film There is a shot of the team in their classic blue uniforms with red trimming from the comics 

The Guardians are bounding across an alien planet Theyre each wearing brightly colored suits each one different blue green red orange and yellow Peter tries to talk to Gamora about their past He asks if she might be willing to open herself up and she says I dont think so Quinn Peter corrects her Quill Its Quill At which point Mantis tells Peter that theyre on an open channel and everyone can hear

"I was impressed by how more often than not that it actually felt like People interacting onscreen and not CGI Hulk Animations The montageaction in most CGI scenes I feel use so much motion blur that theyre justwellblurry There was a bit of that here but overall its becoming more naturalistic Dig it
Eyes flicker and the uncanny valley is usually from the need to add every frame between the movements for smoothness when there isnt much smoothness AT ALL to eye movement They did a good job with the eyes for sure 
This has nothing to to with much of what was covered in the video but just throwing in 2 cents   ",2.0,637
She actually uses her audiencedirected powers at the very beginning of the show for the first time imo when shes about to leave for her trial and then turns around and says to the audience that we probably want to know about all the hulk stuff first so youll actually be interested in the lawyer part of the show or something along those lines,1.0,349
Watching this one thing that may have been an easter egg that I only remembered from this episode was the court drawing of SheHulk with the weight lifters  As a teenager I had a poster by Joe Jusko of SheHulk at muscle beach  Maybe the court drawing was a nod to that,1.0,274

"You hit a soft spot with Ronin  I think that movie is a masterpiece that went largely unnoticed  The acting the dense subtext the camera angles the story progresses while revealing nothing

Awesome",2.0,204
Penelope is actually a really great movie My roommate and I love this movie and have watched it many many times If you havent seen it you should and I have to say its a great movie for school age kids to watch because it will teach them a lot of lessons against bullying others or if youre child is the one being bullied then they will learn a lot about how to love themselves no matter what they look like And for those parents who criticize your children a lot you can learn a lot about accepting your child for who they are regardless of how you had envisioned your child to be Theres a lot to learn from people of all ages Watch it,2.0,647
Great recommendations list Darren Ronin and the car chases awesome and has a great plot Silence Of The Lambs just a superb horror Agree that Anthony Hopkins is on his finest day with his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter Just received my latest Universal Yums from Czech Republic today 9232021 Many thanks for sharing with us and catch you on your next presentation Take care ,2.0,387
These movie reviews are always good and largely because they are honest If a given film is admittedly not the greatest or otherwise flawed  the reviewer still tries  to point out what might be good or desirable about the movie etc Its a very democratic approach Always a good job ,2.0,287
I recently watched Hackers again and realized that its a really good pairing with the original Tron They both present ridiculous representations of how computers work but they are complementary just from opposite sides of the screen Great performances from a great cast in both cases They are solid presentations of how people wished computers worked in the late twentieth century immediately before and after Al Gore opened up the internet to everyone,2.0,462
One thing that makes or breaks a film is how the filmmaker respects the source material in this case being The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris The film respected and captured this incredible book  the casting of Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins with Jonathan Demme directing made it a masterpiece Some movies you sit and watch  Others creat a dimensional world you enter completely and that never really leaves you,2.0,428
While I generally agree with your comments about Ronin the callous disregard of collateral damage  shooting into crowds and causing violent vehicle accidents  was a total turnoff for me They spread injury and death among innocent bystanders without any sign of care or compassion,0.0,285
I just watched Post Mortem on Netflix last night and really liked it  Its from Norway and has only six episodes in the series  Im not sure how I could describe it  horror a little comedy a bit police procedural  I guesssome  It was just really strange and at least to me very entertaining  Also I watch all foreign movies with subtitles so I dont know if its dubbed or not  Anyway check it out,2.0,424
Im sure youve seen Malevolent from 2018 with Florence Pogue but if you havent its just a really well acted horror flick  I seem to like just about everything Florence Pogue is in  Thanks for another great list as I plan to check out Primer and Troll 2 both of which I never would have considered without your recommendation  Pls keep making as many of these lists as you can,2.0,385

I am very sorry for the abuses microaggressions that you had to endure in your profession I had no idea what the word Chef said it in that context meant But I know from my own experience how even simple wordsstatements can actually be aggressions towards other people I have felt that many times in my profession too which has nothing to do with cooking btw

Lucky us that despite those unfortunate abuses they did not make you dislike cooking and quit altogether On the contrary you persevered in your chosen path and now you are sharing your uniqueness and talent with us Thanks again

"The film is set in Jennings County Indiana in 1862 Jess Birdwell Gary Cooper is a farmer and patriarch of the Birdwell family whose Quaker religion conflicts with his love for the worldly enjoyments of music and horse racing Jesss wife Eliza Dorothy McGuire a Quaker minister is deeply religious and steadfast in her refusal to engage in violence Jesss daughter Mattie Phyllis Love wants to remain a Quaker but has fallen in love with dashing cavalry officer Gard Jordan Peter Mark Richman a love that is against her mothers wishes Jesss youngest child Little Jess Richard Eyer is a feisty child whose comical feud with his mothers pet goose causes her heartache Jesss elder son Josh Anthony Perkins is torn between his hatred of violence and a conviction that to protect his family he must join the home guard and fight the invaders Enoch Joel Fluellen a runaway slave is a laborer on their farm his children are still enslaved in the South

We are introduced to the family via its youngest member Little Jess who is forever at war with his mothers pet goose The story begins as an easygoing and humorous tale of Quakers trying to maintain their faith as they go to meeting on First Day Sunday contrasted with the Birdwells neighbor Sam Jordan Robert Middleton and other members of the nearby Methodist Church The mood shifts dramatically when the meeting is interrupted by a Union officer who asks how the Quaker men can stand by when their houses will be looted and their families terrorized by approaching Confederate troops When confronted with the question of his being afraid to fight Josh Birdwell responds that it might be the case His honesty provokes the wrath of Purdy a Quaker elder who condemns people who dont believe as he does

The film returns to its lighter tone as the Quakers try to maintain their ways despite the temptations of amusements at a county fair and a new organ which Jess buys over Elizas opposition but one is always reminded that the Confederate Army is drawing closer On a business trip Jess acquires a new horse from the widow Hudspeth Marjorie Main and is finally able to defeat Sam in their weekly horse race One day Jess is cultivating his fields and notices an immense cloud of smoke on the horizon produced by the burning of buildings Josh soon arrives and tells them the neighboring community has been reduced to ash and corpses Josh believes that he must fight a conviction that threatens to destroy the family Eliza tells him that by turning his back to their religion hes turning his back on her but Jess sees things a different way Josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded Meanwhile Jess is reluctant to fight only picking up a rifle and riding off towards the fighting when the family horse gallops back to the farm riderless

When Confederates arrive at the farm with only Eliza and the younger children present the family and the farm are saved when Eliza greets them on the porch and welcomes them to take all the food and animals they want and feeds them in their kitchen As Jess finds Sam Jordan dying he is bushwhacked by a Reb He plays possum and when the Confederate soldier approaches he struggles with him and takes away his gun but ultimately lets him go free and unhurt He then finds Josh injured and brings him home Each member of the family faces the question of whether it is ever right to engage in violence",1.0,3573

Poor Sterling Hayden must have been Broke as he often was in his beginning years He needed  to do this film  Hayden did love sailing read his bio which probably was the other reason he did the film  Every time I saw him I heard his famous line from Dr Strangelove bodily fluidsand I felt my essence leave my body after the physical act of love making Mandrake,1.0,370

This movie has a special place in my heart  I was with my father who was dying of AIDS and we watched it together the night before he died the next day  I remember us enjoying it together in the evening and he slipped into a coma that night and passed away the next day  Every time I watch this great film I remember him,2.0,324
The Magnificent Seven over time has come to describe the lead actors more than the movie And the most  magnificent of the seven  Yul Brynner Impossible to match him,2.0,172
Possibly not only the greatest film ever made but the greatest story The lesson being that material possession should never take prescendence over our common humanity A dollar bill always looks as big as a bedspread What a line,2.0,233

Even though the movie is a remake its one of all time greats Sure some plot twists are naive and the fightingeffects dont stand to contemporary cinematography but everything else is simply brilliant starting with the original score all the way to the moral lessons the movie brings A true inspiring masterpiece,2.0,322
I first watched this movie in a cinema in 1960s  The righteousness truthfulness bravery and courage shown in the characters in the movie helped to mold my character in the later days of my youth and made me join the uniformed service to serve the public,2.0,257

I completely agree with you about Thirteen Lives I watched it the other night and I wasnt sure I was going to make it to the end It was so intense and I felt so claustrophobic and almost panicky at times watching it Unbelievably fantastic movie,2.0,249
Better Luck Tomorrow is still one of my all time favorite films As an AsianAmerican I never understood the criticism that this film made us look bad That viewpoint was actually way worse and even racist in my opinion What we can only have roles as nerds straight A students martial artists dutiful sons and daughters etc This film portrayed more of my reality at that age than any other film ever did Sure I wasnt dealing and stealing and whatnot I was in all advanced classes and band But I also ran track and played volleyball and had a cheerleader girlfriend and went to parties I felt seen by this film I may not have always agreed with Ebert but I will always respect him for using his influence and voice in the industry to shoot down that nonsense at the time,1.0,786
I wish someone would come up with a streaming service that includes a lot of movies from the 40s and 50s without having to pay extra for them Im a big fan of classics including the likes of Cary Grant Kate Hepburn William Powell etc I used to be able to watch them on YouTube but theyve pretty much all been pulled because of copyright infringement,0.0,357
Thirteen Lives was incredible Its exactly how we as human should be behaving,2.0,79
I really liked Bound It shows even if you have a small budget you can still make a really good movie 13 Lives was good also I watched Marathon Man when I was too young to get into it or understand it I recently watched it on Prime,2.0,235
You could not have been more spot on with Thirteen Lives Darren What an amazing film Incredible Thank you as always for the recommendations,2.0,143
I always appreciate the work you put into your reviews I feel that youre very thorough and honest in your opinion Thank you for what you do JCVD is an amazing movie Very hidden gem,2.0,186
Another killer list Ive said it before but check out Birdy for one of Nicolas Cages earliest movies and Hector and the Search for Happiness Both are terrific movies,2.0,173
"13 lives was an excellent movie I remember hearing the situation on the news I didnt realize how long those kids were trapped and what had to be done to get them out 
Drowning suffocating is a fear of mine so seeing this had me on the edge of my seat anxious as fuck but it was worth it  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  this movie  It was so so good  Great even",2.0,358
I have watched Vikram vedha on youtube in Hindi last year I dont think Saif can beat R Madhwan in acting R Madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie But Saif doesnt look innocent at all throughout the trailer R Madhwans smile was enough to make Vikram vedha a thriller movie,2.0,322
Vijay sethupathi is one of the most talented actor I have seen in south industry n r Madhavan is one of the most underrated actor love the original masterpiece,2.0,159
Krk reviews should be released in theatres all reviews one after another for 3 hours it will become blockbuster ,2.0,112
"Sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on Theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25 Crores for a movie Even highly educated Proffesionals CAs Engineers Doctors Civil Servants etc do not earn this kind of money in India after 10 year of service 

A simple logic if theses actors Including the Kumars Khans Devgans Kapoors Roshans etc start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie  the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price

These Superstars have built their mansions worth 100 Crores and secured the lifes of their children and grandchildren They are living kingsize life with our hard earned money I believe we better stick to OTT or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on YouTube or any other app",0.0,888
I always wonder why his videos are never in trending They are so hilarious yet to the point,2.0,94
Everyone is busy praising this moviebut I prefer the original anytimeno comparison thereBut your reviews are as usual hilarious,2.0,138
Not willing to watch others Review always waiting for Legend Mr KRK,1.0,71
Hey KRK  you are someone who is an well educated well sensed human who is trying to destroy the good works for his own personal interest Everyone can agree that the recent Vikram Vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art Yeah its a remake but why it has made  Because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time  Hrithik Roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work  So guys dont take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like KRK ,1.0,558
"313 hilarious review 
I am Pakistani and I always wait for KRK videos by God big fan KRK bro
I watch your videos everyday because you always made my day with your incredible review also Id say KRKs viewer doing unfair with him because he deserves like similar to views everyone must like his videos because he is doing hard working for us and he always keep us updated about bollywood activities and news so he deserves for views like and followers

2011 when this movie released Vidyut became the nationwide crush  Dhoom 1 for John  Force for Vidyut No one can replace them in these two movies,2.0,148
One of the better expert rates videos Ive seen As a former tanker its cool seeing tanks getting some attention,2.0,117
Love this guy  Roofs are not usually designed to hold 40 ton tanks  This implies that there are roofs designed to hold tanks,2.0,129
One of the best expert videos Ive seen This guy is not just very knowledgeable but also a very good communicator and even an entertaining and enjoyable person I can easily imagine this guy being loved at his job,2.0,219
"A small detail from that Kellys Heros scene is when the Tiger tank traverses the turret the engine could be heard revving
The Tiger turret was was hydraulic operated which was powered by a mechanical drive from the engine Increasing the engine RPM would allow for hydraulic pump to increase speed allowing the turret to traverse quicker",1.0,342
"I am a member of the German army reconnaissance forces which use the Sphwagen Fennek and we sometimes actually call our car the batmobile

Also we still very much work with Auftragstaktik most likely more than any army in the world",2.0,238
Unexpected Chieftain is the best Chieftain  Great guy great channel great knowledge  So glad to see him on this episode,2.0,125
This was immensely enjoyable we need more with Loremaster Moran,2.0,65
The main problem with the tiger scene in fury is that decision making Although independent thinking was encouraged in the German army the choice here to take the tiger out of cover and engage on the move is a miserable decision on the commanders behalf The tiger had no gyroscopic turret so would be very inaccurate whilst moving He also has the ability to kill all of those Shermans through their front armour at that range and cant even be sure they know his exact position Essentially the commander is a tool,0.0,519
In fury it infuriated me that the German tank decided to blow his cover and close the distance with the Shermans The tiger had an amazing advantage but blew it all away,0.0,169
I love how accurate his interpretation of Batmans Tumbler was He says it would only protect from small caliber rounds and something like a rocket propelled grenade would do serious damage That is exactly what we see destroy the tumbler in The Dark Knight The Joker uses an RPG in an attempt to kill Harvey Dent and takes out the tumbler in the process,1.0,356
Im trying so hard not to get too upset with most of these kids and their complete disrespect for some of these masterpieces at first glance because I know every generation goes through this stage Its like an infuriating rite of passage,0.0,239
Im trying not to get too annoyed with Janelle and Lucas but seriously dont judge CLASSIC movies if you havent seen or just by small clips At least the other four arent rude or saying negative things Give the movies a chance because you may actually like the storyline and the messages behind these movies,1.0,310
Janelle and Lucas made this video an awful watch their attitude to something theyve never seen before is unbearable,0.0,117
The disrespect these kids had for pagemaster and the iron giant is crazy smh,0.0,76
Balto is a legend His statue in Central Park proves it He raced the entire length of the last two stops on the modern ididorod without help to get medication for a pandemic that hit Alaska He ran in a blizzard for 8 hours without rest just to give kids children a chance to survive A true legend,2.0,300
"Its not so much the fact that they dont know these movies that makes me mad its the disrespect they are showing towards the animation that gets me mad 

People worked hard to draw those films hand drawn animation and cell animation was tough compared to now with computer drawn animation and a lot of the animation on these movies still hold up",0.0,352
Lucas and Janelle needs an attitude check and respect,1.0,54
"As always Jaxon and Anthony are so funny together by just being competitive 
Jayka and Danny have good chemistry too

One of the reactors though was too snobbish against these classics Wait till you become older and realize that some shows this decade would be considered cringe in the future too",2.0,303
"I get not knowing these movies if you literally never heard of them I get not liking the quality But Janelle and Lucas entire personality throughout this video is lets trash everything we see and devalue every credible thing about it

bUt tHEyRe tEEns No the other teens in this video were great and open minded Other teens in real life are very open minded as well These two dont pass the vibe and I wouldnt want to watch anything old with them",0.0,460

Great video As an established data scientist myself this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle however I almost never go through all of these steps in the same day You can spend whole days just cleaning data tuning models or putting things into production The work that you do can also vary by company some data scientists only work on part of that lifecycle just doing exploration and modeling or modeling and productionization I have a few videos on my channel that complement this one nicely for those interested,2.0,545
"it was a great overview of all the process  it would be great if we get more videos on DATA PREPARATION EDA various methods
for different scenarios",2.0,151
Great video You did great explaining this That said I would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps Specifically data acquisition and cleaning Mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research Furthermore it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found Do some field work say NSF or an FFRDC gives you 2 million dollars for it Go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you dont figure out until your back Oh well This seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies All the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now Now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned THE FIRST TWO STEPS ACQUISITION AND CLEANING ARE SO IMPORTANT,2.0,993

Im currently an entry level Community Manager Data Science is so intriguing to me as it would allow me to listen to userbases and other communities so much more closely You just gave me what I need to get started learning Thank you,2.0,236
I found this video to be very well done When I begin work on a new model I always start with a Google search and go from there Unfortunately you cant do this during an interview I feel like some of the best people on planet earth get overlooked all the time just because employers expect people to start with a blank piece of paper and build out a model Ive been in the data science world for the past 10 years and thats 10 years of proven success If thats not good enough for you writing code on a blank sheet of paper wont help very much at all,2.0,566
This is very helpful thanks for putting this together ,2.0,57
The biggest problem Ive had so far is working with my manager We both have very different perspectives on various problems but he simply doesnt even want to hear my perspective even when my perspective is usually right We are both data scientists but he graduated as a data scientist back in 2003 So hes an old head and I recently graduated Its very tough to get along and having your voice heard,0.0,404
Im learning Data Science and whenever I read job descriptions for entry levels or even for Interns they want you to be jack of all trades and on top of that require you to have 23 years of experience Plus they include big data streamlines and ask you to be an expert on it too along with all sorts of cloud services I mean it feels like theyre demanding an Intermediate Data Scientist and terming it as Data Analysis Intern or Junior Data Analyst role This frustrates me a lot,0.0,487
"Yes theres ambiguity in role definitions In my previous company I worked as Data scientist However I hardly did any data science work It was more like a developer work where I was assigned to test and deploy the ML models in production I could learn a lot about aws cloud architecture and services Trouble shoot real time issues But did little of ML Then I changed my job and joined as Data analyst Here I do little of analysis SQL etc and more of ML like developing models and fine tuning them Cleaning the data feature engineering and feature selection 
I would caution the people aspiring to enter the field because many a times companies themselves are not sure where and how they are going to use data science what are the prerequisites for a successful data science project They lack quality data if they do have data accessing and compiling the data is another issue After aligning with multiple departments as single man army you are expected to give some magical results When results are satisfactory you will be asked to deploy them Here again the streamlined organisational requirements are missing Somehow you drag the project Later you are expected to monitor and troubleshoot issues in production And then after all of this single man army efforts management doesnt see any value in it Just to keep up with trend companies end up hiring a data scientist and expect that person to assume multiple roles and give them an end to end solution They are just giving analytics a try without investing much in it",1.0,1549
I feel like tech jobs always morph we have hiring expansions and more specialities then we have layoffs and more generalizations It does seem like the demand for data scientists dropped off a cliff but Ive been studying it a bit as a way to complement other skills Thanks for the video ,2.0,292
Great insight I got into data science right after college and really struggled to do so The fact that the data science job role is defined so differently at different companies made interviews really hard to prep for It felt like you need to be a jack of all trades and be well versed in data science data engineering and data analyst principles and it was just a lot to prep for Plus a lot of roles require graduate degrees After I got a role I left after a year and transitioned into SWE as like you said the expectations didnt match the reality plus I was also at a toxic workplace I realized that I want to be in a role that is more welldefined and somewhat uniform across companies so if i need to look for a job later Im not being restricted to only a subset of opportunities bc of the different definitions and requirements,1.0,843
"thanks for sharing your experiences The manager who spoke of wanted applied scientists a category I wasnt aware of before this video was odd to me So he was saying that there wasnt enough data science related work for a full time hire or else he wouldnt be wanting someone who could also serve as a software engineer I can imagine companies having this need smaller companies in particular where individuals have to wear multiple hats but if I were a data scientist trying to get hired as a data scientist Id avoid this managercompany I actually left a job in the 90s for this reasonI was being pulled into other jobstasks that werent related to machine learning so I left and joined a company I could do machine learning full time Im an old guy  I predated data science so in that time it was called data mining or pattern recognition and yes Im using machine learning and data science interchangeably even though I know they arent fully interchangeable 

The manager is keyeven if you like the company if you dont respect or are respected by your manager it will be an awful job Remember that when you are being interviewed you are also interviewing them ",1.0,1204
You covered some really great points that Im also experiencing in my current role as a data scientist Tbh I dont even know what Im supposed to be doing and it makes me feel so lost especially since Im still early in my career I saw 2 great people leave the team to work as a data engineer and a software engineer Its absolutely demotivating to see people leave Im also looking into transitioning into a more data engineer andor product analytics role but the interview prep is super overwhelmingdifficult and imposter syndrome really kicks in ,1.0,558
Its really difficult to work as a Data scientist because every company have different expections from Data Scientist And now a days a data scientist should know all the skills like computer vision deep learning Operational research Machine learning SQL and many more There must a  discrete line between data scientist work roles And also as you have mentioned interview prep it is really difficult because we need to prep from scratch  Struggle of a DataScientist,0.0,474
"Preparing for interviews can be arduous because like you pointed out that different organisations have different definitions of a Data Scientist role and Data Science is such an extremely broad term that is often times disputed amongst people You only find out when you sit for the interviews that the organisations sometimes are actually looking for a Data Analyst or ML Engineer or Data Engineer when the interview doesnt circle around what youd imagine it to be But thats the reality and thanks for pointing it out

And most of the time I am just scraping and cleaning the data which definitely gives me mixed feelings about my job role I could really relate to your experiences and it definitely resonated with me Such an insightful video for the ones who want to pursue their career in Data Science because often times it can be misinterpreted",1.0,857
"In my personal experience the harsh reality also included
1 Studying all the time to the point that you personal life gets affected  8 hours of work and 4 hours a day  of just keep up with the new lake cloud  software technique library  bi tool etc 
2 The feeling of You dont know enough You are not enough You briefly mention this and I am glad that  I am not the only feeling the same way I know python enough to do my job but I am not a python expert who can write functions from scratch or change between languages say from python to  java or R I use the existing libraries and move on to the next project",1.0,632

Great video Shane Completely Nailed it As a data scientist myself I was a little surprised at how high the job satisfaction scores were  On the job a lot of my peers find that they arent challenged enough by their positions This is probably because data science is still relatively new and companies are still figuring out how to create value with data teams The other side of that is that once you have a data science role it is pretty easy to land another data science job so qualified data scientists can just leave if they arent liking the position at hand I love seeing the data and trying to map it to what Im hearing anecdotally,2.0,648
I loved the remark about how ifwhen data scientists jobs get automated either the world would have ended or world peace would have been achieved ,2.0,150
Excellent datadriven assessment of this field  I am 57 with a BS in math just retired not really want to work in data science and pursuing a masters in statistics  I have one class in machine learning where neither the professor nor students are over thirty Most of the students are early twenties and some might still be in their teens  I was able to start on Zoom but now that we are back in the class my status is very clear although I keep fit and positive I never lied about my age  that would be creepy but didnt need to advertise it either so long as I pulled my weight in study groups  I feel so out of place but just shake it off and try to keep on moving forward as best I can  You mentioned ageism and while I have not attempted to apply for any jobs yet I have experienced ageism and how ones value can diminish at a job  The brutality of it can be very harsh on the receiving end and wonder why people do not realize they will be there sooner than they might care and wonder if they consider the world they are creating  Me Ill keep on going until I cannot  I enjoy turning data into knowledge  I am sure your analytics show your main demographic are on the younger end but wonder if you will address ageism in later videos  Either way keep the data and its interpretation flowing and Rage rage against the dying of the light,2.0,1368
"Im a data analyst 
I will say you need to be good at attention to detail and actually know your skill set

Thanks for the great content Shane As a data scientist myself who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially given that my own engineering field had few jobs available one thing I have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route If you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline plus the skills you need as a data scientist you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot While traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth You end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do but without the specialized domain knowledge Coming from an engineering discipline myself I was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways I have noticed the same with my other peers who also dont come from the traditional route I say this because I have met with a lot of nontraditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they cant break through They definitely can break through and thrive in this field They offer specialized insights you cant get through the traditional route So if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities like linguistics or english you can become a powerful data scientist with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied such as NLP If you are someone who comes from a STEM field even better because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems All data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science But what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem address user needs and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model I dont mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off but I do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well,2.0,2392
My close friend got his bachelors in Electrical Engineering then went for his Masters in Data Science He is now making 245k including bonuses at Intuit as a Machine Learning Engineer and hes only 26 with no experience Got the interview thanks to his Masters then barely passed the interview by doing over 200 leetcode questions 3x each,1.0,340
"Great video Im a data analyst and just accepted an offer for data scientist position so I have some ideas on the markets for both jobs

In my opinion the window for people with no previous data experience and no degree in an analytical subject getting a job as a data scientist has almost completely closed Those folks oftentimes wont even get past the HR screener

Theres so many new data science and analytics Masters programs that have opened up along with the wide variety of analytical degrees that are acceptable statistics computer science economics physics etc that someone without an analytical degree and without any job experience as a data analyst or other data professional is just never going to get an interview Even if you have a great portfolio the HR screen is not even going to look at it

However if you have experience as a data analyst and pick up one of these new data science or analytics masters degrees the job market becomes super easy",2.0,985

Shane I would highly recommend looking into sub reddit information I looked into data science and when you go to the data science subreddit you will see how it is nearly impossible to get a job in data science Usually people will go into something like Business analyst to data analyst to data scientist as a means of going up the scale Also these subreddits will help you get a better idea of the requirements of different jobs For instance in IT career questions even though IT may be a fantastic career eventually the vast majority of entry level starts at helpdesk with a salary of 1520 an hour and is there for a few years before being able to make something like sys admin,2.0,687

"I agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time I think theres a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about democratization and the experience catch 22 

I feel like your video alluded to what I mean by democratization quite well so I think were probably in agreement there A lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow pytorch and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models I think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boilerplate enough that its ripe for automation using some kind of automl the sqllike syntax that redshift and BigQuery offer or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away This opens ML models up to the techsavy but nonspecialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and MLOPs We still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often its just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day

For experience I really think theres a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless selfteaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people This is where I think we disagree the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you dont talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience The largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you I would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level My expectation is that youd see a massive gap favoring employers at 02 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5 years of experience So while the industry is expanding the companies arent hiring juniors or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program

Together I think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals If workers with domain experience but not a DS education can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job I think were going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry Perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree",2.0,3222
Personally I think you hit one key point the importance of domain experts  With the socalled automation or new technology tools well likely see a shift to empower the domain experts and focus more on the business needs  Just because someones knows SQL or do coding doesnt mean heshe can do data science or machine learning  or more importantly to put out anything meaningful or even useful  Just like years ago people needed to rely heavily on someone who can do graphic design really well or who can use a handful of highskill tools say photoshop really well to even modify a picture or video  These days even kids can snap a picture or video and publish to Instagram or Tiktok  Did the modern photo editing tools make graphic designer extinct No  But it does mean that you need to be REALLY GOOD to be able to survive as a graphic designer  I see the same future for data science field too  Maybe not tomorrow but the trend is coming for sure  If you pay attention to some of the podcasts like me myself and ai most the guests chief data scientists or boss of DS departments arent really of these backgrounds but more business driven,1.0,1165
The automation part was a matter of time since a lot of the work with the data is repetitive The understanding of the business and its needs have always been the most important part of Data Science,1.0,200
"Working as a PhD in a business school we often get hookups with companies about some data and it always shocks me how little they know Id say they are very good at collecting data but they often have no idea how to use it that is if there problem is anything but a straight forward prediction problem 

My understanding are the best skills to have are 1 be able to identify problems 2 be able to decide how to solve the problem Once that is done usually the process is just data cleaning and then running the libraries you decided on already which is fairly trivial though potentially data cleaning is time consuming But honestly dont trust me I had to go do a PhD because nobody would hire me to do even the most basic stuff",0.0,746

Asking if Data Science is dying would be like asking if engineering or medicine is dying There will always be a huge demand for these sorts of careers Tons of people thinking they want to do them is a byproduct of that But just like engineering and medicine most people who think they want to be in the field cant really hack it for whatever reason If you are someone who is smart and hard working you dont have to worry about the field being saturated Most of that saturation is from people who arent very good or who call themselves data scientists because they completed a mooc or two Theres a huge difference between completing certs and degrees and being able to actually do things in the real world The wheat gets separated from the chaff pretty quickly,1.0,777

What a beautiful and insightful explanation of the dynamics of data science It is true that data science demand is growing exponentially and what aspiring data scientists are fearful is lack of knowledgeable that DS is actually evolving and diverse It is become more field specific and one need to master the area of expertise like health business banking etc in respect to the application of DS in it Thanks a lot Thu Vu for your resourceful info,2.0,453
"Data science is extremely saturated at entry level just ask anybody whos applied for a data science job in the last year Moreover data analyst is being rebranded as data scientist because many businesses are realizing they never needed fancy deep learning or advanced statistical models to gain insight into their data but good ole basic analysis achieved the same end at a fraction of the cost If you actually want to work on AI projects these days and not just be a data analyst youll need a PhD in computer science 

Also despite having a higher barrier to entry the outlook for data science jobs is worse than that of software engineering because the demand is a lot less compared to software engineering As data science tools continue to be democratized and automated software engineers with basic stats skills will be favored for data roles due to their better coding skills as well as the fact that the job is just an analyst role so no longer requires advanced stats knowledge for the most part",1.0,1015

1 We dont really care about your background as long as you can code SQL and Python understand the fundamentals of statistics and can apply standard ML models Your education might limit your progress later on but the basics are plenty enough for you to do well as an entrylevel data scientist
2 Communication is really important We expect all new hires to be good on the technical side so what ends up being the most significant discriminator between high and lowlevel is how well you can understand whats being requested and whats important and communicate your results in a way that helps the business This is the number 1 thing I mention to my reports during 11s

"If you want a role where you want to work only with AI and heavy duty programming go for a machine learning engineer job if you want to do statistics and sometimes classic ML and analyze data go for a data scientist job 

Working as a ML engineer you spend way more time reviewing and maintaining code so its more SE from one side you use python for model development and cjava for production the role is building AI products so you are all day reviewing extracting and preprocessing data to then training ML models evaluate them and match required KPIs

In the other hand data scientists positions offer what is described in the video statistics and data preparation engineering and classic ML there is more flexibility regarding tools and programming languages and the final purpose is bringing value in a business perspective with the projects you have

For example In ML engineering you get assigned some set of models that you have to maintain and improve in data scientist positions you get several projects that constantly change Both roles have their advantages and interesting scopes

I have been in both my background is in statistics and I have been working as ML engineer in computer vision in the automotive industry for the last 3 years Personally I can say ML engineering is more fun even more in start ups where you feel you bring a lot of value with your ideas about crazy AI methods",1.0,1427

Great video Tina Loving the minimize input maximize output MIMO series My step into the world of data was from a nontechnical biology background and persistence and grit was probably one of the most important thing because it took quite some time to digest the coding or algorithmic concepts I also resonated with your prior MIMO video on learning data science particularly on learning just enough and start doing projects I also leveraged data science to solve biology data problem that helps to make a positive impact in this video which at the time was a novel thing I repeated this cycle for solving various biology data problems and before you know it topics that I used to get stuck on became less intimidating and started to sink in Your persistence through 200 SWE roles is very inspirational ,2.0,815
Hey Tina thank you so much for always sharing wonderful tips It is almost approaching a year since I had finished my bachelors and still without a job  I really hope I can break the barrier and get my foot in the industry Having zero experience makes everything harder Apart from doing some projects I will definitely try to contribute in open source projects or pick up a consulting assignment,2.0,403

Amazing how much effort so many people put into to getting a job while someone with connection can bypass it all and get the job,2.0,129
Hi Tina this was really great advice about demonstrating your impact super useful for data science people but I feel like its relevant to every field too Please could you do a video on how you deal with rejection Im job hunting in a field thats very new to me not data science at the moment and Im just so afraid of getting rejected because that could mean the end of my dream Also even if it doesnt the feeling just sucks lol,0.0,441
"Hi Tina Do you think doing only analysis is good for your resume For example imagine that I scrape data from glassdoor and I do a analysis on the salaries of data scientists in the US After finishing the analysis on the data I got some pretty cool insights but I didnt use Machine Learning in the end project 
So is a project like that good for my resume
Im a major in Data Science and your videos help a lot",2.0,419

I feel for a local business owner who opened up a coffee shop My two sisters worked there and were very good friends with the owner since she was a teacher at the highschool and saved up enough money to open the shop up Sadly during the pandemic my state nuked her businesses My sisters lost their jobs while the governor praised herself about her actions and those evil businesses were destroying our state She then proceeded to get caught twice having parties spending thousands on booze  Actually watched dozens of business get nuked the same way fun times fun times,0.0,577

"Since I was little I knew Id rather live in the street than become a wage slave and have to relive the school experience of being told what to do Having to negotiate with incompetent managers for a 5 increase every year just sounds insane to me I studied software engineering so I could build my own tools and sell them Took countless 70 hour work weeks but the work does pay off now own half of a successful tech startup Currently using that income to start two other companies with virtually no competition in my area in other industries Im interested in

"TLDR

1 own something
2 try to make it a monopoly either legally or physically eg tie it your personality",1.0,113
This actually makes a lot of sense The company I work for has produced a lot of commercials for a regional car dealershipracing team owner The owner of the company isnt a billionaire but is in a position where he can throw around money whenever he wants That kind of path seems much more attainable than hoping you land a one in a million chance on a startup business or some Bitcoin related gamble,1.0,405
Im a mortgage broker Hes completely right Except the local monopoly thing can be done with a really good book of business Sure you can compete but you cant steal my referrals which supply all the business Offering a Lower price is a poor tactic unless its purely how to learn how to run the business,1.0,307
Depends also on what you define as rich I dont mean that in a philosophical way either just that living standards vary greatly from person to person If you need to have a mansion a yacht and 5 or 6 super cars then its a much greater challenge Also what are the time horizons Is your goal to be rich before you turn 30 Or can you wait until 45 or 50 Because something else they didnt mention in the video is investment compounding interest passive income etc,1.0,477
Being a trade professional such as plumbing or HVAC can be VERY lucrative if you spend the time and money to consistently build name recognition in your local market and maintain that for years If you can become the name that people automatically think of for HVAC problems  you can multiple hire crews to do the work for you You can scale as big as you want and easily become a millionaire  with a tech school diploma  you just have to grow that name recognition and provide quality service,2.0,497
Remember hes a Data Scientist Hes probably studied data on the topic immensely before this interview as thats what we love doing especially with public data thats nice to play with So the advice hes giving probably tends to bounce towards whats most PROBABLE not what will DEFINITELY make you rich In most ways probability can you take you a long way,2.0,361

I absolutely agree with your comments about statistics and I loveownhave read the same book cover to cover There is now a 2nd edition with python implementation BTW reason I am leaving comment is to hear your thought about the actual interview questions I recently went through google data scientist interview 1 hour tech screen and to my surprise the question was straight out coin flip probability and expectation problem I was really surprised because the question is very much contrived and I couldnt come up with the answer very easily at first That was the only question some resume related question before that of course I got in the session As a data scientist myself those type of questions are really hit or miss and personally I dont think itd help to measure ones understanding of stats or technical background How would you suggest prepare those,2.0,884
Thank you for such an informative video appreciate people from real time experienceare sharing it with people which will he a great help to so many Im working as a software engineer but dont think Im good at technical so was thinking to move to non technical roles And these thoughts are really tiring when u end up in too many options and not able to conclude I am with Bsc maths and Msc computers background  and in 2016 thought searched so much how to utilise my maths skills in IT but unfortunately couldnt find so much that timenow when I hear on Data scene I feel I lost so much opportunity  but I would like to resstart my learning and your videos are really inspiring Is it okay for a person with almost 8years gap from Bsc maths to start on Data science now Please reply,2.0,796
thanks for sharing your experience in transitioning to data scientist role  Some of your suggestion is good which is actually what Im doing so far watching different you tube video on on same topic because as you pointed out  different people has their own way of  interpretation of the subject and is more simplified  until you fully grasp the subject  Please keep sharing your knowledge,2.0,394

Did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs I have beginner level on all these programs right now but I feel like I probably wont be able to land a job in data analytics until Im at least intermediate in SQL and at least Python for starters I would appreciate your feedback and would also love to connect with you offline to chat if possible Congratulations again on your journey and your role in data science",0.0,1206
Thank you for this video This is extremely helpful as I am currently applying to data science and quantitative analytics positions,2.0,132
Want to quickly commend you for the consistency and quality of your content I dont usually comment  but from helping me with my UChicago application where I will be attending next year D to now supporting me in identifying my future career I am very interested in data science I am grateful to you for all your work Thanks,2.0,333
"1000 this is an extremely hard coding task It deals with a custom datatype implies the iteration and verification of the end I wasted 40 minutes and didnt resolve it all the solutions I have found include flattering with a separate method than iterating and len verification And the task is formalized in a way that next and hasNext methods should be enough to do the flattening which is again more difficult
I am not sure if it is a suitable task for a middle software developer in a fortune500 company coding interview Comparing this with the explanation of the gradient descend is like chalk and cheese",0.0,630
Ive just concluded my bachelors in Civil engineering but I am inclined to move to the Data science field During my course I learned how to program in phythonin Spyder and SQL and Im still updated with those skills Imagine you are in my shoes what should I do moving forward to learn more about data science and ensure I can  get a job at it Do you think it is necessary to take another course What are the general technical skills I have to master,1.0,457
Great video  I appreciate the honesty  Did you start as an analyst before moving to a Data Scientist role  What role would you recommend for recent grads,2.0,157
A scientist who works in data science has been a godsend Finding a job has been difficult in the wake of my graduation and several unsuccessful job applications After weighing my options I chose to leave physics and hunt for a position in data science Before seeing your videos I was baffled as to why I continued being turned down for jobs despite having two masters degrees one in physics and the other in applied physics Now that Ive seen some of your vids I understand why Glad I found your channel on YouTube,2.0,526
just start my datacamp journey thank you for this helpful insight I have one question how do you know that some company just using you for their free project while they actually dont want to hire anyone,2.0,207

subs Ive been seeing your video on my feed for a while now since I started roaming around to study software development but my true goal was to go up to the data scientist role thats just the goal I have in mind and you just revealed to me that I dont exactly NEED to become a software engineer first if I can land myself to a data analyst role the hierarchy showed me I can still walk up slowly to reaching my goal you are a god send ,2.0,448
thanks man for clearing this up especially in India all IT companies have made a mess about Data jobswhy dont you make a video dscussing these JDs especially from India these all are MNCs,0.0,206

I once had a question how the regressor would look like without any coeffecient except the intercept in a linear regression Could not answer it right away but got the to the answer after a couple of mins I asked the job interviewer if anyone ever got it right after immediteatly and he said only one but he did not hire him So dont worry question arent everything its got more to do with the way you handle the situation with dignity and without being a liar  Also keep your head up iwrote hundred of applications and still ended up at a big corp,1.0,558
I love your videos I had one quibble about your SQL solution to 1 If some publishers have more videos than others then their video durations will affect the mean You could imagine one publisher with 10000 videos and 9 publishers with 10 videos In this case the average duration of that one superpublishers videos will have way more influence on the mean than the other publishers I think your question is better answered by first computing an average for each publisher and then averaging those averages of course this detail may not matter in an interview,2.0,571

"Maaaaaan the way you explain stuff makes me feel like this is something reachable despite of its level of complexity You make it sound somehow easy Not because it is but because you suggest a self development path for those who want to learn on their own There are many out there who put themselves on a superior position maybe caused by their formaleducation ego but for some reason you must follow their same steps which means youll never be as awesome as they are

I have been a data scientist for three years As a data scientist one can only be a generalist until and unless he has domain knowledge of the field his company works in The fascination with data science dies down once the projects are not relevant to your field of interestdomain of expertise Moreover companies now have a hard time justifying the massive amount of investment done towards data science Its better to be a domain expert and then add skills of data science rather than just being a generalist data scientist without any domain expertise Hence Im leaving data science and starting my PhD ,1.0,613

I agree to some points but disagree to some I dont think studying Data Science  and knowledge gained will be worthless in 510 years The core statistics and maths learned in the degree will be useful decades to come Yes some aspects of tech stack will change but the same thing happens in other computer science fields as well The Data Science is very broad field and if one does degree in this field they can transfer those skills into multitude of other fields and can create value for the company and lastly career trajectory in this field is still not fixed as this is nascent field and we dont know how things will pan out in 1020 years down the line,1.0,663

"OVERVIEW

1 Study the various roles in data science by researching and asking people and figure out what is best for you
2 After you a role study the JD for that role in various companies  check what is needed in order for you to qualify for that role
3 Go on linkedin and study the profiles of people who are already in that role
4 The coding is not necessarily the first thing that you need to learn  Studying the theoretical conceptual part first is suggested
5 After the concepts are clear now learn coding and try to work on data
6 Work on a project  Kaggle is a great place to start
 
Nope were not done here

7 Prepare for interviews

"Hi Sundas I have a career in auditing and over time I ended up focusing on producing data models by pulling data from SAP ERP

These days this work is often done by data analysts It requires knowing the data base and handling analytics tools SQL Script Python etc 
I am learning Python and I am preparing for the CAP Certified Analytical Professional certification to learn the methodology and accredit my qualification
After listening to you I think I should prioritize statistics
With my experience I think that I should orient myself towards business data analytics Thanks for the info",1.0,610

My data science journey started last year during the pandemic when I was locked out of my PhD lab and needed to do something productive
My process so far
1 Data Science in R series from Harvard on Edx
2 Reading practical statistics for data science with a bookclub
3 Python programming course
Pre4 Learned some linear algebra calculus 
4a ML course
4b Data science fellowship with DS4A
Now Learning SQL online
Always Engage in DS community and attend talks to learn about various topics

This video is really good and legit I do however want to point out that you can still accomplish huge things in game design on your own or with a small team this day in age There are incredibly powerful tools available for cheap and even free The learning process to build an entire game is long and difficult Especially if youre thinking of an rpg In my experience single player games can be done fairly simply with alot of knowledge and experience multiplayer games are a stretch to even tryalone or with a small team But dont let the reality beat you up If you really really want something you can make it happen Ive been making games with blender and unity for nearly 6 years and have prototypedconcepted my own rpg 5 times Only now in 2022 am i confident enough to build the official version But Ive done it Ive learned enough to make it happen and you can too Knowing is one thing then you have to put in the years of hard work that still exist to bring it to life CREATION IS KING NEVER GIVE UP,2.0,1034

"I come from Indie to AAA studio as game programmer 
If theres something to add every discipline has it own depths on knowledge perfecting stuff like design pattern design principle code conventions CICD pipeline Automate Test etc for programmers is needed when your project grow That come along as other department
Maybe at the first time you think you wont need dedicated Project Manager that handling all daily task and scrum but when project get larger team gets bigger you will need that one and for indie who grow to bigger company usually overwhelmed with this kind of situation Heck if you love making games later on you wont even touch the project as too many things on managerial you will handle on 

If you just started game dev make sure that one day what you want to become is pretty clear will you create your own studio or work for big companies which discipline what studio  this can be matter as a programmer  artist who need align their technology  artstyle

Its two different things to start learning and to make your first serious game When you start learning if you go straight away to make your dream game it will likely be frustrating because you have a vision of the game in your head but you can barely translate any of that vision into an actual game Creating a copy or a remake of an already existing game that you like is a good way to learn When I started learning Unity some years ago after doing a few tutorials I decided I would create a remake of Duke Nukem 3D using some of the assets of Duke Nukem Forever and remaking the first level of the game in Blender this was so that I could focus mainly on the coding side of things and put the creative part of it aside for the project It took me I believe 6 months to finish it it had all the basic game mechanics and the first level of the game and yes it played terrible and nothing like the original But the amount of learning I did thanks to this learning project was really a lot I dont think I could have learned faster other way Another point I would mention is learning to code I think was the most important thing I did When I started making games my game ideas were limited to what I imagined I would be technically capable of implementing after I got a good grasp of coding I feel and I know I could make anything I can imagine given the time to do so,1.0,1398

"Hi everyone I realized I didnt actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games thats why ethical monetization is my specialty now So for sure theres data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions It also encompasses monetization and systems design  though I wasnt formally trained in monetization design before joining its actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first Monetization design encompasses things like battle passes loot box designs game ecoystem design hard currency to soft currency what resources are tradable and purchasable etc designing events and seasons what content should be available how is it distributed what does progression and rewards look like in an event etc and ofc the pricing of it all We also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones We often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction purchase regret MAU revivals etc to get a sense of this

I totally got the eureka moments in every level
It will be easier to automatically grab de magnet
I got softlocked many times so the restart was nice I dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset
Initially I thought I should return to the key hub that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic
Ill love to move while aiming it feels more fluent
 The key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but I dont know how well it fits in the game The doors werent like the key type so it doesnt make sense to open them with it also its kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better
Maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character for example making the positive smile and the negative sad
The main character could shine more while aiming maybe a subtle movement in the eyes following the aim

"As a game developer I have always taken the boring stuff incredibly seriously If you want to maximize efficiency when developing your game you have to work on your framework before you even try working on the entire games campaign or whatever else In fact  and I discovered this the same way you did Mark  by building that framework often times you will accidentally end up building an MVP or demo at the same time

I did this as well Im still working on my first game but just recently I started closing in on the final lines of code for my Unreal Engine 5 framework that I will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off as in when Im not the only employee Well Im working on my framework and I look at the level Ive built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added and I realized I basically just built a prealpha demo for my game all I need is to make the level actually look good because my level design skills are awful and I basically now have a prealpha project Its funny how that can happen sometimes

Either way I always take this stuff seriously Frameworks are everything in my opinion  having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it",1.0,1530

As for games I worked on a game for most of last year and now that I look back on it I made a lot of mistakes mostly related to planing but I did find out I am much better at programming and designing systems than actually making art plus I learned a lot about the type of games I am mostly good at making",2.0,435
Your tip about knowing your forte really resonated with me I too pride my self in character building and story telling Those are my passions what keeps me making my game This being my first game youre other tip was perfect I should make a small short game before putting my all into my dream story  dream game This video hit at the perfect time for me and thank you for your content One question about your stories do you have them all laid out first before you start building your games or do you kind of build the story and the small details of the story as you go drawing inspiration from some of your worlds and art,2.0,631

OOOH  IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE THE NEW INWORLD CHARACTERS SPRITES  also some of the latest decors look soo insane  you and clement did such a great job ,2.0,152
The new character sprites look so good Seems like youve come so far in such a short amount of time With the amount of detail and complexity in not only the art but the code I assumed you were a seasoned game designer and programmer when I saw your 1st devlog almost 2 years ago I was impressed then and even more so now watching Chef RPG progress and improve as you continue to grow as an artist and game developer Its not only fun but incredibly inspiration for the rest of us indie game dev I cant wait for the next update,2.0,535
The complexity throughout blows me away Theres enough going on in a single indoor restaurant screen to make a fixed screen game out of that Instead youre making a game with loads more to explore and do The amount of generosity it takes to make this much content is what I love most and is just as difficult to achieve as making a great game in the first place,2.0,366

"3150 I really like the name Sapiens that you landed on Because that name isnt JUST prehistoric humans It is a game about Sapiens It could be prehistoric medieval modern future or anything

"10308 since we are talking about mines I wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines

Now I understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines which I love because they leave a large impact on the world But it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often

That is why I thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future

There could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is FAR later into development You could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts

The way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks

A MAJOR issue with this though is how the camera system would work I could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however I feel like that might not fit the game I wouldnt have an issue with it but others may

Of course you can always do your standard 1st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldnt work when trying to make mineshafts I think

Edit I guess maybe you could still do your 1st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground

Another thing I thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground I say that as if it is easy when I actually know hardly anything about game development but I do believe that should be achievable

But going far underground would allow you to find metals that you normally wouldnt which I think would be cool Of course it would probably be behind some kind of research that would allow you to brace your tunnels or something to prevent collapse",1.0,2352

It may be overwhelming for someone just starting out But actually you are not saying that we have to be expert on all of these but mentioning important aspects of each For example the part of rules and the events in the game was great and even though it seems obvious i never thought about that I dont make games myself though but i find game making incredibly interesting and difficult",2.0,412

The first game is Wonder and so well polished Imagine if it was released in 90s it wouldve wiped the market,2.0,109

"the first game is awesome
the second one just did what you wanted him to but nothing more
the third one was quite cool but a bit boring also is horror game material
the fourth game looked like if it was made by a 10 year old but still cool",2.0,240
Based on their Fiverr pages the first game appears to have cost 25 the second 35 third 5 and last one is listed at 30 I would have to say 1 was easily the best investment,2.0,180
The first game could end up being successful with proper funding and development I love the idea of the recoil that launches you Imagine that they added bosses multiplayer etc,2.0,180
The first one definitely felt more varied and had more to it compared to the others Which they DID do what they were requested but the other 3 just lookedgeneric in a way While the first had enemies with AI that would attack you interesting level design and the movement and gunplay had more personality to thembeing able to move the gun in any direction using recoil to jumplift off the ground as well as different types of guns to play with I guess it just had more polish to it compared to the others too,2.0,525
The third game looks like it will change into an creepypasta type of game,1.0,73

Tip 1 cant be stressed enough I spent my first year learning courses on coursera and udemy thinking Id get into game design once Im ready That day never came no matter what I learned I never felt ready yet Then one day I just started working on my project and said Id learn new things where I needed to Honestly doing things this way made me progress faster than any course ever has,2.0,395

Shaders were super intimidating but I spent a weekend learning them and am so glad I did it I feel pretty fluent in them not even a week later and have been using them nonstop I needed to use them for one effect but the applications where shaders are useful keep appearing Its definitely a tool worth having in your arsenal And like visual scripting vs actual coding being able to write your own shaders allows you to do performance things you wouldnt be able to do with visual scripting a shader,2.0,508
Imo something thats Extremely underrated especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on Observer pattern is a MUST for game dev with larger projects Having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects and it makes your code more modular each classgame object is its own self contained thing Singleton and Factory patterns as well as SOLID principles are also good to look into Factory less so for Unity since you can use GetComponent to retrieve references for things If youre using Unity learn to use Unity eventsC events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects,2.0,778
Yes if you think you might want to add multiplayer  coop you really should do it from the start suddenly you have to validate everything your players are saying they are doing along with replicating all the right properties without flooding the network and your animations and simulation has to be on point since players will be doing crazy things that AI just wouldnt  we would give AI a pass on,1.0,401

 ground targets such as beamshooting mechs enemy balls similar to the player but a little bit dumb and laser artilleries
 the tank can destroy the turret since the tank has the same weapons as the turret but it has significantly high damage on every shot from the tank
 grenadetype weapons and projectiles i meant by that which has new weapons to choose such as fullauto grenade launcher with a very low rate of fire or just a singleshot grenade launcher similar to the M79
 the shield can spawn by using a shield powerup 
 the player can shut down the turrets system

454 Totally agree with writing readable code I just dont think  and  are the problem at all in my opinion if someone sees that as hard to read they should probably take a step back I think badinconsistent indentation confusing variable names repeated code and organization in general are way greater problems that beginner coders do very often,0.0,358

"My unofficial Tip 26
Comment your code It makes it SO much easier to fix bugs or change things when you can see what pieces of code serve which purposes",2.0,157
Great vid On the controversial tip I agree keep your code readable But Id argue this is more about naming properties and functions and not cramming too much on one line Replacing variable with variable  false leans towards being overly verbose to me I would read variable as not variable personally but whatever makes it easier for you to understand your own code when coming back to it,2.0,403
"A BIG tip I have to give programmers is to avoid micro optimizations As a coder its generally very easy for me to sometimes fall into a pitfall of seeing a piece of my code and trying to optimize it into oblivion

If you have fun then power to you coding is a hobby after all but if youre just doing it to save those precious 2ms its not worth it by any means you can do so much better stuff with your time than spending a couple hours optimizing a system for a negligible boost in efficiency",1.0,503
My reflexive advice for someone thats picking between art styles is err on the side of what you can crank out because you can more reliably finish that,1.0,156
"On that readable code tip 24 Id refine that to say make sure you can read your own code In a game Im currently working on Ive added some variables that I could very easily get away without using The only reason I have them is because they make my code cleaner and easier to work with
Also make sure you can understand your own code and follow exactly what it does line by line It is a good idea to create some model or system to define how your code will work and stick to that model unless an adjustment is absolutely necessary To that end I will create empty methods if thats how my model works",2.0,616

"yo this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was so I feel like I should clear a few things up

First off to game devs who are just starting out dont attempt to do exactly what I did because it probably wont work out well And Im not saying this because I think Im smarter or better at game dev than you In all honesty Im pretty average and tons of people couldve done a lot better in my shoes But thats just the thing not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that I had Prior to this Id been making 2D games and was quite familiar with coding so carrying that over to Unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple I mentioned this in the video but Ive seen too many comments in the vein of wow this was impressive I would never be able to do this which frankly makes me feel a little bad since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience I had and I dont want to discourage anyone who doesnt realize this 

So I just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2D games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions Also everyone learns at their own pace in their own way and the rate at which that gets done doesnt really matter as long as youre able to learn what you needed to learn in the end within reason of course if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print hello world then we might have a problem So even if you have as much experience as I did there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time Because ultimately it doesnt really matter how quickly youre able to learn how to make games As a game developer you develop games and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about not how quickly you can make them Of course this mostly only applies if youre doing this as a hobby and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay you should probably worry a little more

And on the other side of the spectrum to those who think this video was faked it wasnt lol As mentioned before I already knew how to make 2D games and how to program things arguably the hardest part of developing games Because of that the focus of this video wasnt on that but rather applying what I knew to 3D games by learning 3D modelling animation and how to work with Unity which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such But mostly this was just for shits and giggles since I find messing around with 3D games entertaining and I feel like people may be reading into it too much lol Also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar but that was caused by how I usually record clips while video editing and not when Im actually making the games So I just have a weird workflow

And last thing to YouTube why the fuck does this have 500000 views did the algorithm break I can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500000 views and this is definitely not one of them so if youre watching this go watch someone elses video or something this one has way too many views already",0.0,3330

"4624 This is actually insanely important and probably underrated advice There was a time in my life where I ended up stifling all of my random ideas in the name of higher priorities and it unwittingly spiraled me into 23 years of burnout and depression This is all in retrospect because at the time I thought I was doing the right thing but its extremely clear to me now that you need to give yourself the freedom to create and explore eventually youll find the balance of how much time you should set aside for those tangents and sometimes those tangents turn out to be a core part of your final work Sometimes they turn out to be nothing too but dont be discouraged just have fun

Another issue is that whenever you sink that much money into a single project the designers have to give up a significant amount of creative control Business just wont allow that much money to be spent on an experiment Everything ends up being the old tried and true so you end up with very samey uncreative bland games that look really nice,0.0,348
When some people say games from older generations were better I must agree As a kid I imagined how insane the games would look like with so much more options to buy and play with even better graphics and physics But sadly nowadays most titles are just cash grabs and the fun part is ignored its hard to find triple A titles with good and fun gameplay without only pay2win features Thats why Im revisiting emulation indie games and a few AAA titles which are worth the money and also the playtime,2.0,505

AAA game companies are trying too hard to make the biggest game Big being best graphics biggest worlds widest variety be in customization weapons vehicles etc Which will need lots of people and technology naturally Which i could excuse that for big game companies withholding new projects

Except when you have games like Undertale Minecraft before Microsofts purchase Goosegame Goat Simulator powerwash simulator etc Getting loads and loads of sales when theyre developed by small teams These games are very basic graphically have a very short play time minecraft an exception no big budget no fancy effects no extraordinary acting But just simple fun

Heck id be willing to consider Undertale a masterpiece and its a very short game

Hey Reece This is a really cool and unique video idea and great execution  Love the insights and entertainment I got here since I could also totally relate to all the time consuming tasks of game dev Usually I calculate for everything 23x the time I write down because it usually takes longer and unexpected things start to happen always ,2.0,348
The part of estimating the time needed reminds me of the agile development method of estimating so called story points to tasks to put them in relation to each other compared to the size and complexity,1.0,206
"That was anticlimactic
Love the video though Great idea to challenge yourself and get yourself motivated again",2.0,112
Its so hard not to crunch during game dev Big ups  for this,2.0,62
The game is looking great Really interesting challenge too Since you drew I suggest a rematch to find a true winner,2.0,118
Im just finishing up a computer science degree and I really want to get into video game development I play indie games almost constantly and I love the idea of making something of my own that I myself and other people can enjoy but I keep holding myself back because Im scared and dont know where to start This video was definitely helpful and inspiring to me and it makes me feel like I actually have a shot at gaining the skills I need and making something cool,2.0,473
"Hi

Great video really gave some helpful insights Im currently in university studying computer science as every single company in my city said its a requirement but Im also going to be working on  my own projects hopefully I can skip the stage of being employed and start my own company we can dream haha but yeah this has been helpful the information was concise and well presented good job and thank you",2.0,414
My dream since I was like 12 is to work for Rockstar I hope I get there one day,2.0,80
I was considering about joining a coding bootcamp program for possible game dev applications and job fittings afterwards Most bootcamps I have come across are primarily web development for tech companies and job placement with companies like google apple etc Are there any game dev bootcamps similar to those Do they have a high percentage hire rate within so many months after completing their program,1.0,408
These videos are really helpful I watch them with my friends on Voicely whenever we practice coding We all agree that we learned more from YouTube videos than from school lol,2.0,176
Bro I just learned that the college Im planning on attending next year also has Japanese courses which Ive wanted to do since middle school Combining that with game development could lead me to working for a Japanese developer like FromSoftware,2.0,248
"I like the nods to fanboyism in this presentation 
I was unlucky that in my college years you generally only had 1 option in IT Which were basically programming for databases and networking While I specifically went to learn coding and graphics designing to create games I learned the graphics part on my own also because I had a real knack and passion for it Coding was more difficult as information to code for gaming or even a gameengine were hard to come by or expensive
Now almost 2 decades further our country finally is getting a gamingindustry and there are classes you can follow I hope I can start in September and hopefully theyre not too basic as I already have some basics
I already tried creating a game twice sort of First time was more than a decade ago supposed to be a fighting game or beatem up I got my character modelled not textured and even rigged for facial animation But I soon realized that coding and balancing a fighting game is really hard to do So much to consider and take into account And there wasnt even a decent free engine that could provide what I needed
Two years ago I started again but with another genre I liked and more manageable for a single game dev  an arcade racer Luckily I was able to pick up Blender easily where I left of they also made it more userfriendly And found a decent free gameengine Godot Atleast good enough to give me the taste of gamecreation and create a tiny concept I have some videos on my gamedev channel Close Call Racingon channel eyeEmotion
I have been on a break from it because of renovations at home which I have to execute myself And Im changing to Unreal Engine since its change in licensing and its more friendly to devs who are more into designing than programming I just need that gamedev 1 year course to get the ball rolling again and keep me motivated when I get stuck and the information I need",1.0,1944
Thanks to Ricch dawg for being there for me when I truly needed strong support You made this degree happen for me By arranging digit credit card info for me to be able to do the payment have been struggling for ,2.0,215
I was thinking about becoming a game developer who primarily creates code as a hobby I dont like the art side of it I figure I would rather download sprites from websites and use those for a 2D indie game I am learning JavaScript and I was thinking about using threejs and JavaScript for creating a nice small 2D game Maybe for mobile and importing it to ReactNative I am guessing this will take me another 4 months of learning JavaScript before I am able to program my first small game I am learning JavaScript for web development but I think I will at the end pivot into mobile development,1.0,602
hi there This was a great video that has told me exactly what i need to know Could you recommend some groupscommunities that accept someone with no experience at all I have a physical version of my game and i know the rules inside and out I have learnt how to draw digitally and am transferring the art into a format that can be used in the game i want to make and a community that is welcoming and that gives feedbackadvie would be awesome,2.0,447

n8dev I made my own game engine",1.0,100
Pretty brave of Unity to sponsor their 1 competitor Great stuff,2.0,66
just imagine how cool a game engine jam would be,2.0,48
Really like the editing Can def tell a lot of effort was put in,2.0,65
Editing is on point with this one But unitys taking a huge risk sponsoring its competitor,1.0,91
The simple idea of making a game engine from scratch is just too impressive for my tiny brain to comprehend,2.0,108
Cant help but notice N8 is only 2k away from 10k Im referring to the fact that you should subscribe,1.0,104

Maybe he could have a pet wolf with a revolver in its mouth that follows him around and when you right click the wolf shoots in that direction and can hit an enemy,1.0,164
Babe quick MilkManSteve just uploaded,1.0,38
You could give him a revolver that shoots but in a limited range similar to the swords range Cool video btw,2.0,111
I feel like the older model could still work fine if you made him look more closely to a blob around the face area and just had a bigger emphasis around the face,2.0,161

"Look into how Nuclear Throne does attack animations
It simply teleports the sword from one side of the player to the other while creating a separate slash object which slowly dissipates
Ive used this technique in my current roguelike and it works amazingly well",2.0,262
"Sword Have the sword be static on his back or in a side holster then animating attacks that way Possibly do both

Gun Floating revolver controlled via mouse shoot with left click and can do a charged shot with right click Going this route could make the game too easy though

Sword and Gun Do a side holster Sword as mentioned above and have a revolver mentioned above that charges with the damage done to the boss

Edit remember I am smooth brained so may not be good ideas ",1.0,492
Ive always wanted to make a game and Ive come up with many ideas for it but Ive never been committed enough to actually learn game development Glad to see you pulling through and learning it Keep up the great work Also what if for a 2 hit floating sword combo you swing it overhead for the first hit and for the second attack the sword flings out and spins in a circle,2.0,379
"I always tend to make my main characters cute and small It makes it easier for the players to get attached to them so as far as audience feedback goes at least one dude likes the new design

As for animations with floating hands most of my characters have floating hands like yours but mainly use ranged weapons Limited pixel count makes melee combat hard to pull off so dont be too hard on yourself if you have a hard time making it If youre not too attached to the melee combat why not focus on ranged instead Kinda like cuphead focuses on ranged and has melee on the side",2.0,588
My name is Len Thanks for building an island for me,2.0,53
The artwork looks absolutely fantastic That is a huuuge selling point for a game like this People that like really chill games will love that If the dungeons are cool enough for players who like a good diablo grind youll have a game that appeals to a huge variety of players,2.0,280
Yoo thanks for this it teaches soo much im a noob and have a dream and idea of eventually creating my own game If it takes me 10yrs and only my friends play it doesnt matter i will do it,2.0,189
"Hi Julian I love your game so far and am obsessed with the art style of it all I am from California with a Bachelors degree in English and wanted to see if you needed a writer to develop the world lore or whatever storycampaignquestsdialogue you want to bring into Lens Island I dont have a portfolio since I am just starting to reach out to developers for my first opportunity to write for someone but would love to connect to maybe write a test piece for you and if you like it then we could look into working together I will write anything and everything for your game free for a full year and will sign an NDA to protect your work Either way I wish you all the best and thank you for your time


Logan",2.0,719
Im not a game designer I do have a degree in game design,1.0,61
when you cant find a game that has everything you want you make it yourself lol,1.0,81
Been following this project for ages and Im always blown away by the attention to detail in the level design Super excited to see where the game goes from here,2.0,162
Seems like a pretty large scope to launch this December,2.0,56
"The game is looking awesome
When I first saw your videos about your studentprojectgame and your new project it motivated me to work harder and now I am in GameDesign school myself 
Thank you a lot for the motivation


However I think it might be good to add some impact to Trees and Rocks when hit like a little shake 

As of right now the only indication you hit the RockTree is the popup text and that is not really satisfying Not that its bad the way it is right now just as feedback",2.0,503
iTS SO AESTHETIC definitely my favourite aspect is the versatility one has when playing if one didnt want to dungeon crawl they could create amazing buildings etc and vice versa,2.0,179

Here are a few I didnt see in the video but I think are worth a mention
 GraphicsGale pixel art
 Krita FOSS raster art
 Sunvox Music tracker
 Petaporon Simple Piano Roll Sequencer
 FamiStudio Chiptune Music
 FamiTracker Chiptune Music tracker
 Chiptone Sound Effects",2.0,380
The one thing I think you really missed here in the raster editing section is Krita which is especially useful for creating tiling textures as well as having a really powerful painting workflow,2.0,194
For 2d art i personally use krita Its free and pretty neat its good with animation too,2.0,89
Adding this to my Learn how to GameDev playlist,1.0,47
"Really well put together video loved the editing as always and I feel that the topic you picked up on today is one that not many people do touch upon but is incredibly essential I know Ive been developing games for over 3 years now and over one year with Unity 
Really important topic and you grabbed it and gave a perfect video as always
Good Job
PS Almost to 30k",2.0,381
I would just like to say that Audio software wise you have saved me so much research Thank you for making this video and keep up the great work,2.0,145
I know that you cant get into it in a short video but the political philosophy behind FOSS is fascinating In many ways FOSS or at least its driving philosophies predate proprietary software,2.0,196
"Other alts 
Raster Krita It also kind of supports vector
Music LMMS",1.0,71

I like A and C B may be good for caves,2.0,39
"press M to merge two or more points in blender its rly useful 
Also nice vid D",2.0,83
Quick idea the player is able to construct a mastership between islands with customizable elements that shehe can bring back from exploration,1.0,144
i got a cool idea maybe have space pirate raids on your ship in order to keep track of them you would need to use your ships cameras to see where they are heading possibly trying to cut off specific parts of the ship with doors in order to allow you to get there in time to take them out if there is combat they could probably take a couple slots per chest if they get to it then retreat to their ship maybe its always flying next to your ship while you are being raided this could make flying through the world pretty dangerous as at any point pirates could come and raid you maybe there could be a whole security system that enemies have to get passed or maybe they could cut your power in half making you unable to escape until all are gone it could really make the game incredibly fun,1.0,801
This is awesome Ive been working on mine for nearly two years now Its crazy difficult to keep motivated but i always found myself coming back to get work done My game releases next month and I cant wait Youve been doing it longer though I respect you for the sheer amount of motivation youve had to keep up and for starting a project this big,2.0,353
This game has come a very long way and is looking amazing Good job so far Me too is working on a 3d survival game and it is quite fun,2.0,135
Those models look great i love the style also a fan of the editing ,2.0,70
This looks awesome man I love your idea of being able to make your base mobile and fly Your terrain designs and creatures are also very cool Keep up the good work and thanks for the video,2.0,191
"The progress is looking super awesome and impressive Also spending 3 years behind a single project shows dedication Really like the features that you showed here especially where the one where the base starts flying For the enemies A B and C I actually like all of them You could use all three and give different functionality to them like one of them are predator and hunts the other two and the player

045 you could use blenders Merge By Distance to merge the vertex I just enable this by default and give the lowest distance value and blender just merges vertex automatically if they are too close like in your one Saves lot of time

Keep it up ",2.0,666
the game looks great i love the models also the video editing skills are great D i wish i could make even one 3d model lol x i subscribed,2.0,143
Its really bold of you to ditch the safety of your masters degree to pursue your indie dev career Truly inspiring and thanks for sharing your stats I hope more indie devs do their sales overview it helps aspiring game devs like me to gauge whats realistic and whats not when it comes to running a oneman studio,2.0,318
Dude thats awesome Also making a game every 3 months aint so bad Youre officially in the business now I cant wait to one day join the rest of you,2.0,154
"1 to engagement metrics

Also after a year of it being up it would be cool to do a follow up video to see the life span of the game",2.0,135
I appreciate you explaining the logistics of game development It simply is something done out of passion,2.0,106
I usually dont leave good comments but youre a pretty funny guy good personality and its a shame that somebody so smart made very little on a really cool game like that I hope it becomes much more successful Shout out to all the underdog nerds out there who dont get what they truly deserve,2.0,300
"The video was engaging and entertaining I think continuing this level of quality regardless of topic is probably gonna get your channel to some serious viewership in the future You seriously deserve more subs than what you have  

Just keep doing what youre doing Thanks for the video",2.0,290
Dude thats awesome Its a lot of money dont knock yourself down over it Its nice seeing a small indie dev become successful,2.0,130

You should add a playground for the seekers while they wait to be released A mini jungle gym or something like that so they wont be bored while waiting the 30 seconds,1.0,169
a couple suggestions that might be fun to see in game ropes that you can swing on would be a welcome addition to diversify gameplay i think a small fireball would be a cool rock skin to put in the game as well you can recolor it 5 different times to milk it as much as possible im very exited to see this games future so good luck,2.0,338
you should add a taunt ability for the hiders that plays a monkey sound  the seekers can hear it   the hiders can taunt manually but every 2 mins it automatically taunts  because it is still really easy to hide from the seekers,1.0,233
An idea for the rock skins maybe you can make them the gemstones in the cave and make them unlockable by interacting with the gemstones down there Sounds pretty neat,2.0,167
"218
To be honest man this was actually pretty good It has a nice friendly yet also slightly cursed in a good way feeling to it ",2.0,134
Personally I think adding a way for the seekers to set bananas as traps that would show the location of a hider that triggers it might be cool ,2.0,146
I have a suggestion for a mechanic that can be easily implemented into this game in a potential update I suggest making the Cannons functional allowing The Hides and The Seekers to launch themselves across the map using the cannons,1.0,234
suggestion maybe instead of giving away the locations of the hiders after a period why not force to hiders to make monkey noises instead,1.0,139
you should make an button in controls setings go crazy That randomizes your controls Dont forget the reset controls Too,1.0,125

"Summary
 machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data
 there are lots of different ways algorithms that machines can learn 
 the algorithms can be grouped into supervised unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms

 the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be inputoutput pairs or just inputs
 supervised learning algorithms require inputoutput pairs ie they require the output
 unsupervised learning requires only the input data not the outputs

 here is how in general supervised algorithms work
 you feed it an example input then the associated output
 you repeat the above step many many times
 eventually the algorithm picks up a pattern between the inputs and outputs
 now you can feed it a brand new input and it will predict the output for you

 here is how in general unsupervised algorithms work
 you feed it an example input without the associated output
 you repeat the above step many times
 eventually the algorithm clusters your inputs into groups
 now you can feed it a brand new input and the algorithm will predict which cluster it belongs with

 the first example in this video used the knearest neighbor algorithm which is a supervised machine learning algorithm

Hope that was useful to someone

Thanks for the video really enjoyed it ",1.0,1360
"Scenario 1 Facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs
Explanation It is supervised learning Here Facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person Therefore the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labeled data it is supervised learning


Scenario 2 Recommending new songs based on someones past music choices
Explanation It is supervised learning The model is training a classifier on preexisting labels genres of songs
This is what Netflix Pandora and Spotify do all the time they collect the songsmovies that you like already evaluate the features based on your likesdislikes and then recommend new moviessongs based on similar features


Scenario 3 Analyze bank data for suspiciouslooking transactions and flag the fraud transactions
Explanation It is unsupervised learning In this case the suspicious transactions are not defined hence there are no labels of fraud and not fraud The model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as fraud",1.0,1124

I love these videos I just had a tech exec at a Fortune 200 company ask me for any podcasts that could help him stay abreast of currentemerging technology I didnt have a great answer for him but I did mention this series He was looking for more audiocentric content though Food for thought IBM Technology,2.0,315
So I do like this series but this confused me because he switched from one output  should I buy pizza  to another output  is this a pizza or a taco Is this a fundamental difference in what DL vs ML is able to do Or that the first output doesnt require as many layers to become a neural network so therefore would always sit at a DL level Sorry I think I need to do more study and come back to this video,1.0,416

"I study mathematics physics and architecture By definition this man is an ORACLE in the strict meaning of the word 

With all honesty I never imagined someone explaining complex topics with the dexterity this man has He is literally an institution and an outstanding teacher 

The computer graphics and the illustrations are simply perplexing This guy never evades complexity He never evades complex arguments He illustrate the complexity and dive into the exhaustive explanation of the details 

Its extremely rare to see a professor and a dedicated user to put a lot of effort explaining animating and describing mathematics the way he does",1.0,654
"I am just astounded I spent so much time trying to understand this concept Everywhere I looked people would show the similar neural network animation but no one ever really explained and exemplified every single step layer term and mathematics behind it

940 I have a question here For example if that is a part around the 7 this part is a certain amount of pixels in the square It looks like you always have to write the numbers in the middle so that the network recognizes this Is it possible that you write a 7 on the far right or on the left or on the top or bottom and the network recognizes that anyway,1.0,360

I always find it interesting that the statement logistic regression is a classification method is repeated so often despite regression being right there in the name  Like decision trees CART random forest and other similar methods there are both regression and classification versions of the method  In a binary outcome problem we model the process as flipping a coin that has a probability p of coming up heads 1 and 1p of coming up tails 0  We can either predict p a continuous value between 0 and 1 or we can predict the outcome itself which is in 01  The former is regression the latter is classification  Logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff sometimes but not always 05 to predict the outcome  Many times the probability is more important for example lots of the same type of customer  you do not want to assume all of them are 1s when p is estimated to be 06 and sometimes the outcome is more important for example making a decision to approve an application for credit,1.0,1102
Im taking a machine learning course and this is what I needed to completely understand each method Great video concise and easy to follow Thanks,2.0,149
It may surprise some people but logistic REGRESSION is in fact a regression model The output is continuous its a probability Of course you can dichotomize the output and create a classifier Just like you can dichotomize any score function or regression model output So the distinction between regression and classification is not so clear cut,1.0,350
You can also get multiclass classification where the output is more then 2 also you can use neural networks for classification also,1.0,134

The most surprising thing for me is that I have always been interested in AI but did not know what computer science classes to take to follow this through I ended up taking a fundamentals to data science class this semsester and it taught me much of the Basic AI algorithms that you mentioned  I guess luck is on my side lol,2.0,326
Also it may be wise to learn MATLAB to a fairly advanced level before doing ML The jump from basic Python to ML is quite a big one  I was not able to make that jump and got fired from my job because of it You must know how to populate matrices by row and column take the average etc A basic Python course wont cover these things but MATLAB courses are more specific for the type of things you will be doing as an machine learning engineer or data scientist,0.0,465
Hey Tim good video One thing I would say is that I wouldnt recommend beginners to start with Reinforcement Learning  as a matter of fact I think thats one of the more advanced applications Supervised Learning with Neural Nets or Computer Vision would be my suggestions before going to Reinforcement,2.0,305

You should learn machine learning even if you dont intend to be a machine learning engineer   ML is a tool an important one that can help make sense from data   In the future  knowing how to use ML as a tool will be equivalent to knowing how to use Excel today   It doesnt mean that everyone needs to know how to build a spreadsheet application but one would be highly handicapped if he or she doesnt know how to use one,2.0,429
"ML reminds me Big Datas hype few years ago some senior software engineers were scared of being overtaken by junior if they did not learn it so they wanted to train themselves puting an Hadoop stack in every single projects they were working on until they eventually understood it was not the holy grail of data processing It just allows to solve some problems and not all in a more efficient way than other methods

I think people in tech industry should all learn what  ML is what it can do hardware requierments and what gains it can provide so  they can know if they really need it Then maybe they should learn it in depth but first search if there is an existing product that meet their requierements

I learnt how to make train and use neural networks 20 years ago as part of my academical training Did I make NN since then  No Did I have used libs or services relying on NN  Yes quite often Thats quite a different thing",1.0,953
Well as someone who likes research in AI I give major credit to Software Engineer The math is pretty intense to always remember so Software Engineers are very good at making black boxes that are reusable So I think everyone in technology is just as important,2.0,263
I absolutely agree with you From my experience toward my research machine learning is only useful if there is data available to extract features However if you are extracting features from unknown observation then modelbased approach is very useful These days a hybrid between modelbased approach and machine learning techniques are useful,2.0,346

"Hey there Happy New Year Speaking of the new year you might be wondering is this still valid for 2021 and the answer is yes its still valid for 2021

However you might notice a few changes to the websites mentioned throughout video some have had a design change including sites like Made with ML whove recently pivoted httpsmadewithmlcompivot

All of the main concepts remain valid for the new year

If anything changes drastically Ill look to updatemake a new version of this video

This lecture is awesome and really inspiring Ive been a fan now for years now Lex and Im really happy to see your success I just wanted to point out that I believe your analysis of One Shot Learning re human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base The learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling sitting up and standing up This process takes usually between 1 and 2 years This time and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible The process can be accelerated through coordinationspecific training on the part of the parents which occurs quite often Errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road eg requiring knee replacement at 55 Bipedalism is pretty complex and is way harder than quadrupedalism which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim,2.0,1070

"Hi everyone exactly a week ago we conducted a contest in this video The answer to the question is given below
The correct order of working for Neural Network with explanation 
B The weighted sum of inputs is calculated
A The Bias is added
D The result is fed to an activation function
C Specific Neuron is activated

Explanation In a neural network each neuron in one layer is connected to other neurons in the corresponding layers These connections carry random weights The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated and an additional input in the form of bias is added w  x  b The result of this is fed to an activation function Based on a particular threshold value only those neurons get activated that crosses the threshold value

"Hello sir thank you for your videos It really helps from the beginner of the video which you have listed in data science playlist  
The model in default method is 9965 in train and 994 in test Whereas gamma method will lower down the accuracy of the model from 994 to 75 therefore it has explicit shows the gamma method is unsuitable for the scenario however the regularisation has improve the train set to 1 and testing set is retained the best accuracy of model 
Yet kernel parameter as linear has also provided a good accuracy of model
Thank you for your guidance",2.0,581

The hard part about Machine Learning is not the how but the what I can plot learning curves very easily but reading them is another story Thats why I like to focus my ML videos on the concepts rather than the code Chances are that the code is doable in two lines But if you cant understand the output or why your data might give you certain kinds of output youre wasting time and resources,1.0,399
Just about to finish my first year studying statistics A short course was about machine learning so I have some knowledge and understanding of machine learning so this was a very interesting video We got to use and tweak different types of predictor models We split the available data into training and test data and then used the training data which included the outcome variable to build the models and the test data which didnt include the outcome variable to test the models and later compare their results to the true outcome variable,2.0,547

"Hello how are you 
From my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic 
However if you want to reach an even wider audience considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak English I suggest
1 To associate the subtitles even if in English as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery
2 That the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language

Can you please explain all the sub fields in AI ML DL like NLP computer vision etc  any other major part that I dont know even 

In software engineering we have specialized paths for different types of engineers Like for web development frontend technologies are same html css js For backend one may choose a programming language php node js aspnet and a database 
Again for mobile developers they may choose Android IOS or cross platform React native flutter with database knowledge APIs  basic knowledge on how web works

My question is in software engineering one may become a very good software engineer even he only concentrates on web or mobile dev can an AI ML engineer pick his career in his filed of specialization like only NLP engineer knows very less about Computer Vision or Computer Vision engineer knows very less about NLP",2.0,893

Firstly I cant thank you enough for starting this channel 
Im here after I saw your video about how to pick up the basic skills to become a data analyst in 3 months video and want to let you know that I had started the Google data analytics course on Coursera about 45 days ago and have finished 2 courses in the certificate series Do you think it is possible for me to pick up the same skills you mentioned in your video through this course 
Do you think the Google badge on the certificate might give it an edge
I honestly feel the pathway you described in your video takes a more in depth approach which might be beneficial 
Would really really love to hear your thoughts on this
It would really mean a lot if you replied

"I would also like to point out that actually understanding machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics as was mentioned as a benefit being part of something will be EXTREMELY difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability  statistics In fact at my university in order to enrol in the first machine learning course you need to have taken 4 semesters of calculus with proofs as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops one or two courses in linear algebra and 2 courses in statistics 
Thats not to say its impossible to use ML without that of course it isnt However it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge much more so than with required programming knowledge for ML 
So yes you will be a part of something in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with but its a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ML publications at a meaningful level or be generating their own custom models",1.0,1115
In my eyes the second con is the worst thing that can happen to you in ml In many cases I would eagerly wait for about 56 hours for the model to train to see it not work at all in the way I intended Id keep training the model day after day after making small changes in the  code to see its performance not getting better at all,0.0,335

"Tim always posts videos on topics that I am currently practicinghave in mind These coincidences happens so much its scary lol 

Love your vids ",2.0,147
"Im taking a few online ML tutorials and have a text book not related to the course and I have to say that it is very similar to what I did in econometric with regards to predicting The regression analysis in ML is the same as I did in econometric but I just I didnt use python to do it I was using Stata but you could use R to do the same thing and now days Im sure they are teaching python in economics At any rate even after taking econometrics and taking a ML course I still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful Albeit I do recognize that ML is a large topic and the first part of learning ML that I am doing including the textbook all start off doing Regression Analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesnt use when they talk about ML and the other parts I have yet to get to like AI and Neural Networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about IDK

I often hear people say that ML is used for large datasets like at Netflix Google Amazon or etc to help suggest something or something along those lines Well thats all fine and good but I dont work at a company like Netflix or Google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill The other problem is that to use ML at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ML course that it is very complicated and wont go into Thus kind of making the example of these FANG companies almost useless in the short term and medium term When you learn about ML you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chartgraph with a line through it eg the trend line Technically you could use EXCEL to reproduce some of the things I have learned in ML so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating  Or other things in ML like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age salary and whether or not they bought a car You can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes 70k will they buy a car It will be based off a percentage of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not  The problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes And real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc So it becomes hard to do your own projects in ML because they dont really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects     

Most of the time the ML tutorials focuses on how to do the predicationtrend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using They just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset This is a huge issue if you want to try doing ML on your own data because they dont teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a smallmedium business or say your website has x amount of traffic etc  

Im often left wondering how the ML regression Analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter For example in my book they talk about using ML to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression Or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 57 factors But to be honest the housing sample is a great example but I often have trouble trying to think of a problem that I could create using ML to predict a result ie my own project Also the examples often are intuitive like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be I dont even need data or run ML on it to know that It can get demotiving at times So the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true Like predicting gas prices will be higher in the Summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacationtravel during summer Also they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter Its 200 pages like that Countless hours of videos from tutorials saying Now of course the real life data will not look anything like this but you get the idea    I am kind of stuck inbetween smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ML and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what I want Im tempted to skip 20 hours or 200 pages ahead and dive into the Neural Networks but cant stop thinking that maybe Regression Analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way  will be helpful in the AI section or whatever 

So far its like learning basic Statistics but in Python",1.0,5003
Im a data scientist and 95 of my job is data collection and preparation its still a cool job but its not all model development,2.0,131
"at first I thought i will learn machine learning in 6 months with some coding experience i dedicated 5 hours on normal day and 10 hours a day on weekends to study the field and make it in 6 months
and guess what in reality it took me 1 year of hard working and studying this field to be able to build deploy deep learning models and to only begin comprehending state of the art models and begin to mix different algorithms to solve a specific problem
time may vary from person to other but real hard work and dedication is required
if i was to go back and change the way i learned things rather than just jumping to the field 
first to learn data structures and algorithms programming logic
then try to learn and apply some basic algorithms like binary search reverse linked list string manipulation this will help you so much to improve coding skills
the first step will help you so much in processing data solving problems related to data and getting your models to work using your own way
second learn some basic calculus and statistics linear algebra probability dot product  gradient descent
third learn machine learning algorithms and try to apply them using your programming skills",1.0,1214
The only thing holding me back is that it took about 30 mins to implement a classification algorithm with a data size of around 20 numbers on a powerful laptop It was straightforward and a lot of fun but when the size of the data increases it might go on for even a week with GPUs It pays well but so does frontend development at any decent company This video didnt give any valuable inputs to make a decision,0.0,414
IMO Machine Learning is a lot of math It is very difficult to find an interesting job without advance degree if it is the goal of learning ML,1.0,144

I have a PhD in AI and I can say that Andrew is THE BEST machine learningAI educator I have ever seen on the field The deeplearning specialization is just invaluable for any interested learner in DL,2.0,201
One of the people that inspired me to do artificial intelligence in areas that matter Without Coursera I would have not gotten where I am today Thank you for this conversation Lex,2.0,182
Whenever someone uses the word It turns out I remember Andrew Ng I love Andrew Ng,2.0,86
when someone else allowed me the good fortune of helping them a little bitIts a great time to be alive when people like you Lex and Andrew share your knowledge with the world simply to help them a little bit  I believe the little bits will make the world a better place,2.0,281
As a GenXer I enjoyed this interview so much It made me actually feel like I was experiencing the internet we were promised decades ago A well thought out and intelligent conversation that in the end leaves the viewer in a state better than when they first pressed the play button Well done,2.0,297
I took Ngs class on Coursera years ago It switched my career trajectory from academic to industry and spurred my interest in making things Awesome to see this interview,2.0,173
This man got a great voiceover career available at anytime,2.0,59
"This week has been awesome First Scott Aaronson and now Andrew Ng 

Lex itd be really cool if you could get someone working on the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning like Sanjeev Arora Ankur Moitra or Costis Daskalakis Itd be super interesting to see the conversation between experts on two different sides of the same coin applied and theoretical",2.0,366
Im a physician from Brazil learning ai and this fine man helped me a lot thank you sir I salute you,2.0,99
Machine learning is an incredibly powerful numerical tool Man I love how far weve come technologically,2.0,106
"You have the best way to describe what Machine Learning is I was wondering what its real meaning and I then found your answer in video 
I recommend all who dont know the meaning to see this video
Thanks Oxford",2.0,214
"Great introduction Question is it always the case that humans need to input the potential features that are used for classification For instance the ML algorithm uses the animals height length and face size as features for classification with computer vision being used to map images to these features Do some ML algorithms create these features and features maps automatically or are these always created outside of the algorithm 

PS What did you use to create this video it looks great ",2.0,504
I love the way you explained plus the diversity ,2.0,51
AI is already here and that is not such a bad thing Can computers become self aware Yes I think so in the not too distant future,2.0,132
Best explanation of machine learning,2.0,36
Awesome Succinct  Very effective for a newbie to understand the concept,2.0,78
well explanation love it,2.0,25
Great animationkeep it up,2.0,27
Thanks for sharing what is machine learning using such good animation,2.0,71
I am currently enrolled in a MSc Machine learning masters here in the UK and we are learning both the theory and putting it into practice using the assignments There really isnt a problem of doing it both Stop telling yourself you cant If you put in the time and effort with the right learning mindset and method you can learn to eat and drink at the same time Just need to be smart about it Stop putting these limiting thoughts on yourself It really isnt that hard,2.0,478
"I came for a machine learning related talk but I got a life lesson thanks Daniel nice content 

PS I was thinking about going into ML field but I now realized its due to engineer disease Im sticking with web apps at least for some time until I can decide what I love and what I dont",2.0,290
"Ive worked for about 2 years with MLcomputer vision and a lot of the things in this video resonated When I started out I was frustrated that I couldnt dive directly into designing new advanced mathematical models right away but I realized there are a lot of boring things that need to be in place before thats even relevant data curation annotation testing frameworks etc just to name a few There are a lot of interesting problems to solve along the way that I probably wouldnt even realize existed if I stayed in academia for a PhD 

I think there is a point to be made for switching back and forth between learning tools for the sake of tools and solving problems though As long as you spend enough effort to make some progress each time it can really help keeping things fresh",2.0,796
I come from a physics background and usually we spend a lot of time concerning with theory trying to enrich our theoretical knowledge as much as we can A lot of colleagues in my department dont understand that trying to learn everything is an infinite loop During my masters I realized how important is to just start doing things with curiosity which led me to collaborate in two amazing projects Now that Im finishing my masters and starting to get into ML engineering I see how this mindset is even more crucial to let you accomplish the things you want Amazing content you put there mate Thanks from Brazil,2.0,621
Back when I was learning to code I didnt know anything or what to do and how to do it I asked a friend of mine how I could what books I should read etc first thing he did was stop me in my sentence and say you dont need to research all these functions and data structures and take notes from textbooks you just need to know what is possible and that really reasonated  with me because once you know what is possible you can think of a problem and as the video states learn by doing my friend said to work Im projects I want to solve or replicate and implement what I have learned that way Rather than sitting around reading these books,1.0,649
I really like the point about engineering toolboxes I think thats where a lot of the burnout comes from I work in DevOps and teach full stack so going to school for machine learning sounds like a large leap Learning how to build better ML pipelines are much more worth my time,2.0,281
Ive just started exploring this field And this was a really good reminder to get so early on the journey Thanks a lot,2.0,121
"Excelente video con una pregunta filosfica profunda Gracias por compartir esta reflexin sobre la base de tu experiencia
Pregunta cules son las tres herramientas framework data base and code writing de las que hablaste en el vdeo que t usas",1.0,251
Hey Daniel just discovered your channel a couple days ago and Im learning lots Thank you,2.0,92
This is great Focus is key A playful approach can also speed things up depending on how you learn and of course patience For those interested in R and python the latest R studio IDE is great and allows you to run both side by side with reticulate It can seem a steep curve but those with a grounding in R and statistics you can run ML scripts side by side and learn the similarities and where they differ,2.0,410
